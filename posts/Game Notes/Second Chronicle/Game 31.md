### GM Notes

	- [ ] Carlo - Borso - fed vitae on a regular schedule
	- [ ] Carlo - Lorenzo (City Guard)
	- [ ] Carlo - His brother -> Has been let go.
	- [ ] Andrea - Lucia, Maria, and Luca are probably always okay because Andrea is on top of things, but could also list them here
	- [ ] Salamah - Ra'iis (Raven) + street kids

### Pre-Game
- [ ] Questions, comments, XP etc

### Plot
- [ ] Salamah catch up
	- [ ] Specifically the question period with Vincent - 1 question left each
- [ ] Hunters from Sorin's sire show up at the end?

### Game Start

Salamah witnesses the bloodhound being nose blind
Salamah goes to create abyssal spies - keeps them with her for now
When she returns - Andrea and Carlo are heading to talk to Vincent

Vincent
- See large rat leaving Vincent's - Andrea nods to it, Carlo gets the fuck out of the way, Salamah gives it its space and then mutters about giant rats back home under her breath
- Recap of Vincent scene
- Salamah's question - What exactly aren't you telling us about the spear or Carthage?
	- Vincent tries to be intimidating - Salamah is slightly intimidated
	- However - the spear may have belonged to the Nosferatu Antediluvian, and the fall of Carthage was not a fun time, so there may be hazards he doesn't know about
- Vincent's question to Salamah
	- What aren't you telling us about your activities in the catacombs (gives specific route she uses when she enters alone)
		- Salamah answers: I am a practitioner and researcher of the Abyss and there are certain areas where I feel closer to the Abyss and find my studies are vastly improved.
	- Vincent will make a note of another area of the catacombs tainted by the Abyss, since where she goes is nowhere near the last Lasombra stronghold. (Vincent has suspicions about the lost Nostferatu, who disappeared into Salamah's Oubliette (Though with only 2 successes he doesn't have anything solid))

The coterie returns to the estate for the end of the night

The following morning
Andrea wakes up
- Lucia is there
- Andrea checks on the dogs - there is a smelly church, a square/park with a fountain, and another place he can show us
- Goes to meet Francesco - brings Lucia
- Francesco is fairly cavalier towards mortals/humans - they're food - he's spent a lot of time around Paolo and it's obvious
- Francesco mentions a Tzimisce sorcerer
	- Andrea bristles and Francesco asks if Andrea has knowledge of Tzimisce sorcerers
	- Lucia chimes in and mentions Sorin (not by name)
	- Andrea mentions that he wasn't a sorcerer though
- Francesco asks why Andrea hasn't turned Lucia
	- She hasn't expressed a desire to lose the day
- Francesco bluntly suggests that Andrea get someone else to turn her if she is important to Andrea
- Lucia seems very intrigued by this idea
- They return to the estate

Salamah wakes up
- Looks around for the coterie - wants to look into the Hunters but is waiting for Andrea's dogs

Carlo wakes up
- Note on face - please use the note tray next time
- Goes to find Borso
- Makes a paper airplane and throws it at Borso
	- No real news
- Goes looking for Andrea - finds Salamah, who is also looking for Andrea
- No idea where he is - maybe his dogs know
- Dogs are being unhelpful - Andrea will return before food time
- Salamah asks Ra'iis to fly around and look - but he comes back with nothing
- Salamah does some reading and Carlo sharpens his sword as they wait for Andrea

Andrea returns
Corus leads the coterie to a small house in a relatively poor neighbourhood
- Not much going on in the neighbourhood
- A woman and two children sitting at the table, a pasta dish sitting in front of them
- Salamah leaves an Abyssal spy at the house
Next the coterie is lead to one  of the guard towers
- Carlo willl talk to Borso about the guards there
- Andrea asked Corus whether the smell is still there - Corus isn't sure, but it was inside
Head to the church next
- House near the church - where the priest was burned 40 years ago
- Andrea decides to enter the house in obfuscate
- Seems like a normal family home
- Andrea will ask one of his animal ghouls to keep an eye on the house

Head back to the estate
- Andrea needs to feed - feeds on both Hans and Hugo
- Carlo goes to talk to Borso about the guard tower
- Salamah goes to investigate the library for anything on Carthage - finds very little

Salamah hears a tapping on the window - it's Ra'iis
He has info about armed men walking down the  street nearby
Salamah goes and finds Andrea - relays info
The coterie rush out to find them and investigate
Andrea and Salamah get super sneaky - but are spotted
The leader shoots at Andrea with his crossbow - almost staked
Leader demands for creatures of darkness to come out of the shadows - heavily accented Italian - only Carlo realizes that it sounds like Sorin
Carlo steps out and tries to tell Andrea to lay down
Andrea steps out and uses Song of Serenity
They are looking for someone specific - Sorin
Carlo - "Sorin's dead"
Leader asks how he died and whether we had proof
Carlo says we have no proof
Salamah mentions Sorin's belongings - without revealing herself
Another hunter shoots at her but misses
They demand everyone comes out - tell them where Sorin is or die.
