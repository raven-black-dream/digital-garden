### Game Start

Game recap
Andrea, Sorin, and Salamah meet after they awaken and feed
- Sorin is in the corner of the library, drawing something with a human shape
	- We know where we're going, right?
	- Veronica was maybe a Noddist?
		- Nico said that may have been a good path to follow
	- Andrea wants to look through the notes and see if that was mentioned at all
		- There is a section on the fresco
		- Have given up on finding the artist
		- Note: given her penchant for mythology, it's probably mythological
			- Not recognizing it from the Book of Nod
	- Andrea doesn't know any Noddists, but Pietro might
		- Sorin asks if he'll do it for free
		- Rarely does anything for free
	- Andrea asks whether we should talk to Pietro now, or look through the remaining notes first
		- Salamah - the question should be asked of Pietro sooner rather than later
	- Sorin offers to kill two birds w/ one stone
		- Is going to leave his hand to look through the boxes, doesn't want Andrea's servants to ruin his hand
		- Andrea will tell Luca not to let servants in the library
- Sorin severs his left hand - twists it off
	- Gets hungrier - looks at Lucia as the only mortal in the room
	- Left with a perfectly clean stump - no wound
	- Andrea and Lucia leave the room, Salamah stares in fascination
	- Sorin gives one (1) eyeball to the hand (in the palm)
	- Hand scampers off to look through the crates of books
- Andrea and Lucia go talk to Luca
	- WTF was that?
	- Sorin is creepy - probably the only one in the city
	- Salamah is also creepy - probably not the only one in the city
	- Tell Luca not to let servants into the library
	- There's a threat - Sorin has left something behind
	- Wait what?
	- Clarification that it's his hand
- Andrea and Lucia return to the library - there is now a hand with an eyeball in its palm reading voraciously
- Salamah has been watching the hand in fascination
	- Startled when Andrea speaks
	- Almost ready to go, just need to write a note
	- Writes note to the librarian at the university, asking about the Book of Nod in a nonchalant way
	- Asks Andrea to get a servant to deliver it - gives detailed instructions
	- Andrea gets Cecilia and Alfonso to deliver the note together
- Andrea makes sure to lock the library before leaving
- Coterie heads to talk to Pietro

Pietro's Office
- In a surprisingly good mood
- Andrea asks if he knew if Veronica was a Noddist
	- He didn't, but why are we asking
	- Fresco discussion
	- If anyone knows, Brother Antonio would
- Salamah knows of Cappadocian history with Giovanni
	- Andrea clues in ones Salamah brings it up
	- Does Salamah have an issue with Cappadocians
		- No, it's just interesting that they're hiding in the same city she is
- Time to go talk to Brother Antonio
	- Sorin waves with his severed hand

To Elysium
- Makes so much more sense
	- Cappadocians are necromancers, Giovanni are better at it
	- Probably don't say that in front of Brother Antonio
- Dimly lit - Cainites decided to hold gatherings elsewhere
- Brother Antonio has a personal rectory off to one side
- Andrea introduces us as we step in
- Ask about whether Veronica was a Noddist
	- Talking about the fresco
	- Actually from Revelations of the Dark Mother
	- Creation story told from Lilith's perspective
- Andrea asks if he can give us a lead on a copy
- Brother Antonio has a copy of the Book of Nod
	- Sorin asks how big is the book
	- Depends on the edition
	- The book he has is thin - approximately 70 pages
	- Book we're searching for would only have to be 60 pages
	- Salamah tries to convince Brother Antonio to let us look at the book and see if it matches the cypher
		- Probably barking up the wrong tree
		- We should check every avenue available to us
	- Andrea asks about leads on the Revelations of the Dark Mother
		- Potentially fewer editions than the Book of Nod
		- Many people have written Books of Nod
		- Giovanni's copy is probably a forgery
			- A ghoul claims to have found the original
	- Would still be good to test all copies against the cypher
	- Does not know where any additional copies would be
		- Does know that before their chantry was ransaked (or emptied of Tremere), their library would be a place he would look
		- May not be wise to venture into that place
			- Wards, traps, etc.
	- He agrees to let us test the cypher
	- Return to the estate to get the cypher

D'Este Estate
- Library is still locked
- VERY frustrated hand
	- Everything it has found is journals, very dull
- Andrea pulls out a verbatim clear copy and then some additional parchment for testing
- Head back to Elysium

Elysium
- Brother Antonio lends us his copy of the Book of Nod
- Salamah (with unspoken agreement from Andrea) sits down with the book and the cypher
	- Gets mostly gibberish aside from really common words
	- Looks at words on either side of the supposed cypher word to see if that's any clearer
		- Still mostly gibberish
		- Gets something like "on the first day of the fifth month of the year" + gibberish
- Determine that this is not the copy we want, but we seem to be on the right track
- We'll search for other copies and for the Revelations of the Dark Mother
- Salamah gives the book to Andrea to return to Brother Antonio
	- Inform him that it was not the right copy, but it was worth trying
- Andrea suggests talking to Pietro about the traps at the chantry
- Salamah would like to work on her studies, Sorin suggests we take care of our own tasks and then reconvene the following evening

- Salamah wants to go study the Abyssal section of the catacombs
	- Uses Arms of Ahriman to probe at the Abyssal door
