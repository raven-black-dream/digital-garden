### Game Start
Game recap

Decide to go looking for Salamah before entering the chantry - she's not at the estate
- Andrea gets Kerberos to hunt down Salamah
	- You want me to hunt down THAT creepy bitch?
	- I will get her, I just don't like her
- Andrea lets Kerberos out to track down Salamah
- Kerberos follows the trail of frightened and complaining animals
- Kerberos finds Salamah, grabs her robes, startling her - she swings and misses because Kerberos is a dog
- Kerberos tells Salamah that Carlo is looking for her - and that she's frightening all of the animals everywhere
- They return to the estate, sassing at each other
- Carlo asks Salamah to go as backup to the chantry - she agrees and they head out there
- Andrea wishes them good luck as he'll be heading to his primogen meeting

Andrea
- Feeds from Balc
	- Calms him
- Takes Lucia to Zohan's place for the meeting
- When the greeter opens the door and Andrea asks if Zohan would mind if Lucia comes in, the greeter mostly stares at Lucia and then says Zohan probably won't mind at all.
- Zohan is getting measured for some tailored clothes
- When Zohan notices Lucia he admires her and thinks she's a snack
- Andrea says she is his (Andrea's) ghoul
- Zohan is aghast at the fact that someone as pretty as Lucia is with Andrea
- Lucia conveys that she is perfectly happy where she is
- Zohan tries to get Andrea to agree to new, tailored clothes - when Andrea doesn't say much, Zohan tries to recruit Lucia into getting Andrea to agree
- A bit of a tennis match back and forth
- Zohan works hard to get info out of Andrea - particularly whether he can change his appearance
- Andrea goes to change his appearance
- Tailor takes Andrea's measurements and asks about potential clothing options
- Zohan starts a fashion show for Andrea and Lucia

Carlo and Salamah
- Head to the chantry
- Salamah steps on a fire sigil and lights herself on a small bit of fire, but manages to put it out
- Salamah promptly gets them lost, and dawn looks like it'll break soon so Carlo finds them a nice windowless room to hide in for the day

Andrea does make it back before dawn, but upon realizing that the others aren't back, there isn't time to look for them

Next night
- Carlo and Salamah wake up very hungry - Carlo immediately pushes/punches open the door of the small broom closet they're in to get some space
- They find a single rat, but in going for it they only manage to kill it too much
- They continue on, and Salamah catches the scent of blood and goes straight for it
- They discover Sorin's lab with several humans
- Both go for humans to feed from and drain them
- Carlo gets attacked by the Szlachta
(Evan is coming up with a plot line here. There is someone scrying on them. Not sure who... possibly Filin... possibly someone a bit more sinister.)
(Gargoyles -> Possibly pissed off because they had a deal with Sorin. to be talked out.)

- Carlo drains the last human
- At least Salamah is less creepy than Sorin
- Carlo and Salamah looking around for anything Sorin has left - research etc.
	- Carlo finds the well over and over again
- Salamah finds Sorin's study - collects all the documents that she can find - gets Carlo to help carrying them.
- Leave the chantry
(Perhaps Balc, perhaps Pietro....which is really Pietro forcing Balc. you know fairness all around.)

Covering Andrea's evening next game
Coterie reconvenes as Carlo and Salamah return with armfuls of documents
- Andrea is pacing around waiting for them to return
- Talk about the experiments and giving them a "good end"
- Andrea takes one of the books to go see if Balc can translate.
