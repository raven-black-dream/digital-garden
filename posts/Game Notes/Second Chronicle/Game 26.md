### Game Start

	- Drops a scroll with the Cappadocian seal on the group and then leaves through the window again
	- Brother Antonio requests Coterie Carlo's attendance
	- Carlo arrives and finds several of his past victims standing in neat rows
		- Were people that Carlo ate
		- Carlo is HELLA confused
		- The six that spoke the loudest
		- Carlo is the rooftop murderer
		- Hide your kills better or have fewer indiscretions - but Brother Antonio wil keep his secret
		- Brother Antonio will be watching, and so will THEY *grand gesture at corpses*
			- Will they be following me around?
				- *SIGH* - not literally, but I may get the Giovani to bind their souls so they can remain ever vigilant
		- Carlo will do his best
	- Carlo returns to the estate super frustrated - slams a bunch of doors and goes and trains in the courtyard

	- Andrea freaks out
	- Salamah comes to investigate
	- Andrea says that Carlo should stop killing people
	- But it's hard
	- Salamah breaks in with 'if you kill everyone, you can't eat them'
	- Carlo understands
	- Andrea is now confused/shocked
- Ghouls investigating murder of Lena's ghoul
	- Was a mugging gone sideways
	- Ghoul had Fortitude which is why he made it so far before he died
	- Was a bad neighbourhood - nobody pointing fingers at anyone, not talking to cops etc.
	- Truant officer steps away from rounds
		- Talks to another about weird ("unnatural" stuff)
- Carlo has discovered fiction
	- Meets with Nico

Salamah
- About a month after the translation/presentation of Veronica's notes and the reinstating of prestation - Pietro knocks on the front door of the estate
	- First knock is LOUD
	- Second knock rattles the door in its hinges
	- Third knock is more of a crack
- Carlo activates celerity and potence and dashes to the door
	- Hears Pietro's voice as he reaches through the new door hole to open it himself
- Carlo asks who it is and what do they want - doesn't recognize Pietro
- Pietro kicks Carlo back into the central courtyard and through a wall
- Salamah hides in a shadow and waits to see who's invading
- Andrea runs in and exclaims 'Pietro!'
- Carlo runs back in and grapples Pietro with intent to yeet
- Fails.
- Pietro trips Carlo and rips a strip of the door off and stakes Carlo to the floor
- Pietro asks loudly if he can enter the house
- Salamah steps out but keeps her distance in case it's an Andrea-only conversation
- Pietro takes a deep breath (*unusual*)
	- Asks if he can leave Carlo like that - Andrea will clean it up
	- Good he can listen
	- He's come from the Prince - to present the coterie with the deed to the domain immediately surrounding the estate - state exact roads that mark the domain - significant bit of merchant quarter
	- Lena of Clan Ventrue considers the coterie's boon from her to be fulfilled
	- Still treat neighbours with respect
- Pietro requests some of Salamah's time so they retreat to the library
- Andrea attempts to pull the stake out of Carlo - needs potence to get it out of the floor - goes to talk to Luca about a new door
- In the library
	- Pietro asks Salamah about the creatures she had watching him
	- She could be of use - and if she's interested he has work, and if she's not, he'll still use her in that way
	- She's interested
	- He wants her to look into Lena and potential hidden communications
	- Pietro leaves - gently closes doors behind him, tells Andrea to send him the invoice
- Andrea takes the stake to Luca to discuss a new door, floor, and wall
	- Luca was hiding - yay self-preservation skills!
	- Andrea tells him what happened
	- Lucia comes in - who'd you stake!?
	- No one - Pietro staked Carlo - YAY! - Lucia! Inside voice!
- Salamah heads off to make some minions and take care of her oubliette problem (Nosferatu)

Andrea
- A few nights later a note is delivered to the coterie
	- It has been decided to make Balc more useful - he will be away indefinitely

Salamah
- Several months later - asked to spy on a Toreador - been acting a little shady
	- Salamah sends one of her abyssal spies
	- Gets a panorama of a Toreador orgy
	- Spots Andrea and Lucia sitting off in a corner awkwardly
- Spy with Lena sees an exchange between her ghoul and Lucia

Andrea
- Talking to Pietro about where Balc is
	- Providing services to the Prince as he did with Sorin
	- Gone for the rest of his life

Salamah
- Picks up a raven ghoul - buff bird - Ra'iis
- Likes to hang out on the roof or in the central courtyard
	- Possibly pulls corvid pranks on Hans and/or Carlo

Time Skip Narration
- Florence was in flux
- Getting the prestation in order put the city in more order
- Marcus' hand on the city lightens - doesn't appear weak or not caring, but he prefers when the city governs itself
- Giovanni presence in the city has made the Cappadocians uncomfortable
	- Lorenzo swore an oath - the Cappadocians should be safe, but they do retreat into the city's works
- Brujah - rambunctious sort as always
	- Carlo has a small amount of sway
	- Most wouldn't care about politics and prefer to rebel against it
- Ventrue - continue grumbles about unfairness in how they're treated
	- Lena - shows just enough respect and compassion to the coterie - they are neighbours after all
- Malkavian - Filin has stepped away - rumoured that he's in torpor
	- Whispers that that was not his choice
- Cainites of the Warrens return to their normal ways - keep tucked away in the catacombs - a little more spacious now that there was that explosion
- Carlo's ghoul Lorenzo - risen to Captain of the Guard
- Carlo's ghoul Borso - also promoted - doesn't believe he'd be a useful leader of men, very happy as a sergeant
- Still voices of discontent in the city
	- Since the shade was defeated and the murders have slowed
	- People are returning to normal patterns
	- Some few still meet in the dark of night - head home moments after dawn

Cainites rise
- All is quiet, sense of unease
