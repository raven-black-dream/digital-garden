Recap
- Time skip

Much unease.
Much hunger

Salamah goes to survey the domain and feed - her street kids bring her a pouch of coins and shiny jewelry

Carlo wakes up and Borso is being sassy - leaves a note directly on his face
- Goes to train with Nico

Andrea wakes up - note from Lucia, going to check in on the guy that Salamah absolutely wrecked early on.
	- Night Terrors, but doesn't really remember anything specific
	- My thought: Salamah is the Night Terror
- Goes to check on Ernst's chapel - nothing is as it was left
	- Normally there would be a white altar cloth, several candles, and a crucifix
	- Now there is a purple altar, different candles that have been moved, and the various religious artifacts are different
	- Signs of someone other than Andrea or Lucia
	- It is Andrea's week to do the tidying and it has already been done
- Andrea writes a note, then turn and the crucifix begins to glow and Andrea turns and bolts

Salamah goes to feed - Finds Giovanni Rosso III (in his late 50s)
- Memories
	- Born into a large, wealthy merchant family
	- Giovanna's great grandson - now with grandchildren of his own
	- Night of celebration - acquired a smaller business
- Salamah bodies the corpse towards the catacombs to go feed the Abyss
	- The abyss whispers thank you
- As she's leaving Andrea runs directly into her
	- If he had continued running it would've been directly into the oubliette
- Salamah and Andrea walk back to the estate together

Carlo is in the courtyard and hears the other two returning - heads over to greet them
- Small talk
- Sudden loud, long, vorciferous string of swearing
- Then a crash - then a feathery ball of raven and owl burst through
- Salamah and Andrea rush over to separate them
- As Salamah tries to calm Ra'iis down, Carlo the Herald shifts back to his humanoid form
- Ra'iis is unimpressed and calls Carlo a half-breed so Salamah removes Ra'iis from the situation
- Andrea talks to the Herald who has a message from Vincent
	- Our debt to Vincent has come due
	- Need to go talk to him
- Andrea finds Salamah and leaves a note for Lucia about the chapel

Head down to the Warrens
- Meet Jack (sp?) who looks like she's trying to be exotic (pale, blonde, blue eyed)- she changes as she sees Carlo approach
	- Very attractive woman in rags - trying to subtly get Carlo's attention
	- She does not take being ignored very well and steps in front of Carlo and takes off her shirt 
- Carlo finally notices - says he didn't see her because he was thinking
- Andrea is trying to maneuver her socially while Salamah makes biting commentary
- She seduces Carlo real hard (yes I wrote that.)
- She feeds off him, then changes back into her normal self
- Carlo gets real confused when he comes back around and asks if 'she left'
- Jack slaps Carlo and storms off
- Andrea and Salamah collect Carlo and head off to talk to Vincent

Andrea takes all of them along the most expedient path possible, but there's a house in the way, so they go a different route

Arrive at Vincent's area
- Now with Actual Door (TM)
- Andrea knocks - Vincent invites us in
- Large rat on Vincent's shoulder - providing running rat intelligence commentary about the coterie - Vincent shushes it
- Vincent would like us to collect an item to pay back the boon we owe - once he and his sources figure out where it is and how to get it.
	- It's a relic, but that's all he's comfortable saying right now, will give us more details as it becomes valuable for our search.
	- Likely a relic of the Nosferatu Antediluvian. To what end will need to be decided.

- Carlo fails at feeding once we leave, so he returns to the estate to feed on a member of staff.
- Salamah goes to check in with her spies
	- Gets a bunch of responses TBD
- Andrea goes to talk to Luca about potentially having to figure out travel
	- Luca is still there and very distracted so Andrea startles him
	- Lena is apparently cooking the books in the neighbourhood
		- Renaissance version of the "Community Better Business Bureau"
		- Once we got the domain, Luca requested the books and has been attempting to add up the columns, but they don't add up and he can't figure out where it's all going
		- Money appears from Lena to pay for things, and then disappears but the amounts don't add up
		- Andrea isn't really sure - given time they could probably figure it out, but Lucia walks in and interrupts
