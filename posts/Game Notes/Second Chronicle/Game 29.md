Recap

Andrea wakes up
- Lucia's head resting on him
- No notes from Zohan lately - what is he cooking up?
- Lucia hands over a note with Francesco's seal on it
	- Will be in town - wanna meet up at your haven?
- Andrea sits up suddenly, Lucia gets shoved a bit, lands gracefully
- Andrea is hoping to meet Francesco somewhere NOT around the coterie's domain
	- Decides to meet where the Abyss opens in the catacombs
	- Francesco is probably already in town, so Andrea writes a note back to meet tomorrow night
- Andrea and Lucia are going to go deliver the note together
	- Though Lucia says she's been in more dangerous situations before

Carlo wakes up
- Borso is pacing - there's a tension he can feel around some people on the beat
	- People were edgier than normal, but no one was doing anything
	- Because they're using the city watch as a key part of Carlo's political aspirations, they can't just go around beating people over their heads with sticks - as effective as it is
- Carlo tells him to get to know the truant officer they've been keeping an eye on
- Borso's going to go help Luca with some more of the financial investigation
	- And make sure Luca gets some rest
	- Andrea's been trying that for 40 years, so good luck

Salamah
- Shadow spies are fighting over her attention and showing her everything at once
	- Toreador - glimpse of his eyes as he looking at a particularly good painting of a noblewomen - clearly entranced
	- Crap-ton of rats
	- Conversation - couple of merchants coming through the city gate
		- Wonder what 
		- Large group
		- Gathering?
		- Wilderness?
- Salamah gets a tension headache from the competing intel
- She tells her spies to stop and to go one at a time
- Her spies tell her its a her problem and leave
- Salamah continues to try and process what she saw

Carlo and Andrea are both leaving, but Andrea is going quickly and directly through a tunnel he finished during the time skip. Salamah is staying at the estate for the time being.

Andrea
- Catacombs where the Abyss portal is look like they normally do
- Andrea drops the note where he normally does and then leaves
- Returns to the estate with Lucia

Carlo
- Going to go to the Brujah palazzo to find a training partner
- Is not particularly quiet when he leaves

Salamah
- Sound of door slamming causes her to wrap herself in an Abyssal blanket

Andrea and Lucia come back
- Lucia senses Salamah's Nocturne
	- Clings to Andrea
- Andrea focuses on the surroundings a bit more and can kind of sense the Nocturne as well
	- Can figure that it's down one of the hallways
- Andrea heads towards the cold, Lucia is impeding his movements a bit
	- She is super freaked out so Andrea attempts to extricate himself from her clinginess
- Andrea knocks on Salamah's door - wonders if she's okay
- Salamah realizes she's been spreading cold into the hallway, so releases it and opens the door
- Explains, mostly, that she's okay and still wants to go meet Angelo
	- Brief wondering if she's training Auspex
- Salamah closes the door and Andrea and Lucia leave her be

Carlo
 - Spars with Alessandra at the estate - takes some hits
 - Returns to the estate
 - Slams the door even harder because Potence
	 - Also if he slams the door, he'll catch anyone following him in Obfuscate (OOC note: I kind of what this to happen now)

Coterie
- Borso is ushering Luca out of the estate
- Andrea is in the library paying attention to Cerberus
	- Cerberus is MAKING Andrea pay attention
- Salamah arrives at the library and surveys the scene, but stays out of it
- Carlo joins her at the door and starts laughing
- Andrea pushes Cereberus off and stands up
- Discussion of what we need to know from Angelo and what we know about Angelo
- Leave for Elysium

Elysium
- Not super busy, but not empty
	- Carlo the Herald
	- The Harpy
	- Brother Antonio - standing awkwardly in a corner looking like a corpse
- Angelo is late - the coterie approaches the herald to see if he has any info for them
- Angelo runs in screaming and terrified
	- A couple arrows sticking through him and a broken off spearhaft sticking out of his body
	- Yelling about how he should be dead
- Carlo and Andrea go to calm him and sit him down
- Salamah goes to look outside
- Angelo horrified that he's not bleeding; doesn't know what a Cainite is
- He was in an alley, ambushed by several people - ran away and came to Elysium
- Andrea keeps trying to explain that he's a cainite, Carlo asks about Filin
	- Filin can tell the future
- Carlo tells Angelo to just ignore Andrea and keeps asking about Filin
- Hasn't seen Filin in about 5 months
- Normally Filin goes to his coterie (Francesca and Ginevra) so he doesn't know where to find him
	- Francesca and Ginevra would be less helpful
- Andrea asks about the people who attacked him - he gives the intersection; they called him devil spawn and attacked
- Filin also hasn't left any notes or bits of prophecy in the last several months
- Filin had been spending time with Sorin, but not really anyone else
- The last conversation Angelo had with Filin, Filin mentioned torpor
	- Elaborate explanation about how torpor is actually a meditative hibernation
	- Salamah tells him to ask Nico about it
	- More elaborate explanation about why it's perfectly normal for a library to stay open all night
	- Convince him to talk to Coterie Carlo if he needs to talk to the guard
	- If he hears from Filin, let us know
- Carlo the Herald walks over, pulls Angelo's head back by his hair, and force feeds him a glass of blood
	- Tastes better than food does now
- Angelo leaves
- Carlo the Herald tells us Angelo has been told repeatedly that he's a Cainite and it doesn't stick, ever.

Coterie splits up
- Salamah goes to talk to Pietro
	- Informs him about Filin and the attack on Angelo
	- Coterie is tasked with solving the hunter problem and making it go away
	- Salamah mentions the conversation overheard by her spies, but isn't able to give him any more detail
- Andrea and Carlo go look at the scene of the attack
	- Andrea's auspex just snaps everything into focus
		- Many signs of terrified humans waiting for a long time
		- Auras clinging to places - violet and orange (combo of excited and afraid) - but it's a bit too diffused to follow
		- Not a permanent set up
	- Andrea wants to get his scenthound to track
- Salamah arrives and recounts her conversation with Pietro
	- Coterie is tasked with this problem - make it go away
- The coterie makes plans to head back to the estate, get the dog, and go searching
- On arriving at the estate, Andrea spots a note by the door marked with Francesco's seal
	- Manages to get the note without anyone else seeing as we enter
- Andrea excuses himself as quickly as possible to read the note
- Salamah finds a note inside the house
	- "The object is in Carthage" - Vincent
- Andrea leaves and opens his note
	- Francesco states that Andrea's Domain is probably the more secure location than a section of the catacombs.
