### GM Notes
- [ ] Salamah's shadow and eerie presence
- [ ] Ghouls:
	- [ ] Carlo - Borso - fed vitae on a regular schedule
	- [ ] Carlo - Lorenzo (City Guard)
	- [ ] Carlo - His brother -> Has been let go.
	- [ ] Andrea - Lucia, Maria, and Luca are probably always okay because Andrea is on top of things, but could also list them here
	- [ ] Salamah - Ra'iis (Raven) + street kids

### Pre-Game
- [ ] Questions, comments, XP etc

### Plot
- [ ] Some more player agency I think - and bullshitting
- [ ] Maybe that foreshadowing Ashe's arc through Salamah's spies

### Game Start

Recap

Salamah wakes up - not hungry
- Heads out to give a report to Pietro
- He asks her to find Filin - who hasn't been at the last several primogen meetings
- Advises her to seek out the Malkavians (oh joy)
- Goes first to look for Nico who is at least in a predictable location
- Maria is there - Nico is in a bit of a mood
- Salamah still needs to talk to him unfortunately
- She goes to his office, he's in a MOOD.
- Back and forth with semantic dickery until he Commands her to leave his office
- She goes and sits outside his office
- Nico closes and locks the door
- She continues to wait

Carlo
- Wakes up - no note on face
- Borso is there - it was a day
- Carlo puts Borso in charge of acquiring an enclosed carriage for the coterie to travel at some point in the future - when they get more intel from Vincent
	- Maybe they won't want a carriage though - so Borso will look into options (7 successes worth of options)
- Some banter about sparring
- Carlo goes to feed - finds Hugo -> Would like to figure out what Hugo's 0 successes on a roll to figure out if he was alright after being fed on is. (It isn't a physical thing. Probably something psychological.)

Andrea
- Wakes up - no Lucia
- There is a note
- Andrea decides to work on the financial books a little more
	- Luca has been working on them - Andrea asks if he found anything interesting
	- Andrea finds some very small patterns - a few small businesses
	- Luca answers Andrea's questions about businesses related to the patterns that he saw.
		- Where money is going in - association with politics
		- Looking awfully like "investing in business" (*cough*bribes*cough*)
	- Andrea starts looking into the businesses more - it's going to take awhile

Salamah
- Does not notice shit. Much reading.

Carlo
- Notices rustling papers in Luca's office and increasingly annoyed mutterings
- Goes to investigate
- Luca and Andrea are flipping through several ledgers angrily
	- Faenza Trading Company
- Carlo asks if they want some help - Andrea says sure and Carlo leaves to go get Borso
- Borso kind of nudges Andrea out of the way - says to leave it to him and Luca

Carlo and Andrea spar - Carlo consistently has the upper hand, which is expected, but Andrea isn't getting his ass as kicked as expected.
- Realize that Salamah hasn't been around all evening
- Decide to go to the library and see if she's there - but also tell Nico about Carlo learning Dominate

Library
- Andrea asks Maria if Salamah was by
- Maria explains what she witnessed with Salamah and Nico
- Andrea and Carlo find Salamah reading by Nico's office
	- She's in an area of silence
	- Andrea motions her over
	- Salamah explains why she's there (now with sound!)
	- Carlo is convinced Nico is the only Malkavian in the city besides Filin, so starts banging on the office door (in silence)
	- Andrea mentions that maybe Carlo the Herald would know something
- The coterie heads to Elysium

Elysium
- Talk to Bartholomeus (the harpy)
- Ask about Filin or other Malkavians
	- Filin didn't really have associates other than Sorin
	- But the closest thing to a sensible Malkavian is Angelo
		- Not in Elysium right now - Bartholomeus can probably put us in touch with Angelo or his coterie
			- ToDo - Create a coterie for Angelo.
			- Potential plot? A neonate drops off a note for someone else in the city (maybe Carlo the herald and confuses it with coterie Carlo)
		- Take note to Carlo to send a message to Angelo
		- Much sass
		- Andrea steps in and coordinates - tomorrow, 2 AM, at Elysium
		- Carlo flies off to deliver the message
- Coterie Carlo is asking around more generally about Malkavians to learn 'brain stuff'
	- Francesca (?) - She's a Cassandra
	- Ginevra - little less with it most of the time
	- Filin - primogen - the one who occasionally lets the doves go at the church (insert church here)
		- Once read the entrails of a cow in court - bunch of gibberish, seemed to think it was important

Head back to the estate
- Find Luca and Borso with the books - which are much more orderly than they were previously
- Sheet of velum laid out on a table that wasn't in the office before
	- Conspiracy-board style
- System of bribes/antibribes?
- Domain likely won't collapse if we don't do anything about it
- Borso yawns and wanders off towards bed - he's got the morning shift
- Getting late for us as well
- Luca mutters about Maria potentially being pissed off at him when he gets home
