### Game Start

#### Downtime
Carlo
- Carlo and Borso will likely be the ones to break in places
	- Hugo is also very into this idea
- Nico will ask for a significant boon
- Can learn presence on his own
- Framed Giovanni Rosso IV -> Giovanna's Great-Great-Great Grandson

Salamah
- Heals health and willpower
- Academic contacts know nothing about Niccolo Giovanni
- Builds more oubliette

Sorin
- Can find some info on thaumaturgy, but it is not Koldunic sorcery

Andrea
- Poking around the Nosferatu Warrens and the collapsed tunnel
- They're a little suspicious
- New staff to replace retiring staff

#### Main
Night falls
Interesting month
- Members of the Inquisition have murdered each other
- Series of thefts - main suspect from a surprisingly wealthy family
- No creature killing in the streets
- Florence has returned to some sense of normalcy

Andrea wakes
Lucia hasn't been right there the last few nights when he's awaoken - in the house, but not next to him
Sitting at the foot of wherever he sleeps
The day has gone well
Andrea to talk to Luca
New staff are settling in
Maria is making sure he rests

Carlo wakes
Things are quiet
Borso is not necessarily right there when he wakes - very often working the evening city watch shifts
Grumbles that he doesn't have a snack
Goes in search of other Cainites ("the real people")

Salamah wakes at the estate
- Still cannot lie
- Goes in search of the coterie to figure out next steps with the Giovanni

Sorin wakes in his lab
- Goes to talk to Balc
	- A small group of travellers has been seen leaving the domain
	- Probably about a month ago - got the message via messenger pigeon
	- Small group on horseback - about 5
- Feeds
- Heads to the estate

Coterie at the estate
- Salamah runs into Carlo first
	- No new information about the Giovanni
	- Borso has joined the city guard now
- Andrea comes down from Luca's office
	- Knows that Alessandra had run to Venice
	- Mentions this to Carlo
- Alessandra had started a rumour that Carlo is a diablerist, so he's been avoiding her and her friends
- Salamah or Sorin may be the best options to talk to her first
- Salamah is not great at her usual abilities still
- Carlo suggests going to Guidobaldo first
	- Salamah mentions that it may be problematic to do that immediately
	- Maybe Sorin is the best bet to start
- Sorin arrives - Salamah reiterates conversation
- Are there any debts  that she has that we can exploit?
	- Maybe talk to the harpy?
	- Probably not really going to work
- Sorin should just go show up and talk to Alessandra
- OOC Side Note: Revenant pigeons (also ghouled crows or ravens...maybe)
- Carlo fills Sorin in on important Alessandra facts (and the diablerist rumour)
 
Andrea takes Sorin to the Brujah Palazzo
- Doesn't go in
- Sorin walks up to the guards who let him in after a couple questions
- Talks to Alessandra regarding contacts in Venice and the Giovanni
	- Gives her Niccolo's name - last one who had what we're looking for
	- Could put us in touch with someone who could get a message to him
	- Sorin agrees to a minor informational boon in return
	- She gives him a note with a person's name and details on how to find them
- Sorin asks if Alessandra would like to spar at some point in the future - she's game
- He leaves and heads off to find Andrea
Andrea doesn't know the contact, but at least there are directions
Return to the coterie
Determine what to say in the letter - Salamah suggests being vague
Salamah writes the letter and they seal it with Carlo's seal
Everyone goes to the place where Alessandra's note says to go
Carlo tells him what we need and pays a reasonable price
Gives address so we can get a response
Head back to the estate
Scatter

Carlo
- Goes to harass Borso on his patrol - finds crimes happening nearby and tells Borso so Borso can stop them
- Feeds - hunger frenzies

Salamah
- Asks to talk to Andrea
- Asks if Andrea would teach her Animalism
- Potential trade discussion
