- [ ] Ghouls:
	- [ ] Borso - fed vitae ???
	- [ ] Balc - fed vitae on 10-06-1515

### Game Start

Recap
Heading to the chantry
- Andrea first
- Then Carlo
- Then Sorin
- Then Salamah
Andrea turns on heightened senses (sight, hearing, and smell)
As we walk along the path, there is a section of smooth, shiny, stone wall that the path leads up to. Other walls are more roughly hewn
Can't see any traps yet, Carlo reaches out to touch the wall, looking for traps or anything else
About halfway down the wall, his hand slips through the wall.
He wiggles his hand up and down and, finding nothing, steps through
There's an unseen step and then on the other side there's a chokepoint and a door
He looks back to us and confirms what's ahead.
Andrea trips on the step as he goes through, but is fine
Salamah also trips but is fine
Sorin trips and falls, landing next to a glyph, but not hitting it
Sorin has no idea what the glyph is, but he points it out
Salamah knows the glyph is something to do with fire, heat, warmth, etc.
Andrea, with Auspex, focuses intently on the glyph - seeing incredibly specific points of the glyph
- As he comes back to the world, he notices nimbuses around the members of the coterie - unlike what was around the glyph
Salamah tells Sorin to get up slowly and not touch the glyph
Andrea says the glyph still seems to have active magic
- Salamah - and means fire - tells everyone to study it and keep an eye out
Carlo leans in to study it, but tries not to get to close
Andrea looks for additional glyphs
- More around the frame of the door - basically everywhere in that wall
- Asks Salamah if she can read any of it
Salamah looks
- Around the door frame looks like writing (Perception Stuff and Bigger on the inside than the outside)
- The rest of the wall - defensive glyphs (Hardening of the Stones - Like a steel wall but made of stone)
Very sturdy stone wall, heavy oak door, forged hinges that go the whole width of the door, iron ring in the middle
Andrea tries to look at the glyphs to tell if they're active
Carlo offers to try the door - gets a piece of paper from Andrea to run along the side, checking for a lock - there appears to be nothing between the door and the wall
Carlo returns the paper - it's crinkled
Carlo decides to try and push the door instead of pulling - it does not budge
Carlo then pulls the door - it glides open as if on freshly oiled hinges
Willpower check to not get lost:
- Andrea: 9(Success)
- Carlo: 4 (Fail)
- Salamah: 5 (Success)
- Sorin: 3 (Fail)

Hallway through the doorway - ends in a T, which splits to a series of hallways
Andrea goes down to the T to look around
Messy crit on knowing where to go
- Knows he's directly below the chantry
- Knows mortal mages used to live in a particular place and they are all dead
- Smells a lot of vitae in one of the corners of the chantry
Andrea says we're directly below the chantry and there's blood on the other side of it, and takes off straight there
Carlo takes off after Andrea
Salamah follows a little more sedately
Sorin goes with Salamah

Andrea heads through a door - room is soaked in blood
Giant gold chalice of vitae
Robed mess (corpse?) in a corner of the room
Andrea crosses the room and downs the entire vessel of vitae
- No longer hungry
Carlo asks if Andrea is done charging in blindly, as that's supposed to be Carlo's job
Andrea notices the extensive ritual set up that he just disturbed
Salamah and Sorin catch up
- Reach a point where we see stairs up and a slightly open door
- Salamah checks the slightly open door, and there are stairs down
- Decide to take the stairs down
- Reach another hallway where we see a wide open door
- Enter the laboratory that Andrea and Carlo entered previously
- Head through the other open door to the ritual room
- Glyphs over open door - containment glyphs
- Salamah stops Sorin and looks through the door before crossing through it

Cut Scene
- Same location, but better lit
- [[The Hungry Shade]] Fiction (Ercole and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day)

There was definitely an abyssal summoning here - probably a Hungry Shade
- Clearly an amateur
- Nothing about the ritual is correct

Salamah explains about the ritual, the hungry shade doesn't seem to still be in this room, could be in the chantry or in the city
It's probably fine that Andrea drank the vitae
Goes and pokes around the body, it falls in a way that surprises her and she flails and kicks a book across the room, it hits the wall near Carlo's head
- Book: [[In Pontem Umbrae]]

Andrea remembers the book
- Book Ercole borrowed
Salamah asks to look at it - it's absolute trash from an Abyss Mystic's point of view
Andrea - but if this happened 40 years ago, how have we not heard about anything, can these things go dormant?
Salamah - perhaps, or perhaps it found the Abyssal door in the catacombs
- Andrea mentions that the area by the door had been disturbed the other day, Salamah does not mention that it was her
Decide to continue through the chantry
- If they come across the shade, try to kill it, after they leave Salamah will research into a banishment ritual
Salamah takes the book with her when they leave (to destroy it)
Heading upstairs to the chantry
There is a lot more space upstairs than Andrea remembered there was - more than the floorplan should allow for
Coterie heads up to the library
It's a disaster - more so than before
Andrea sees something glowing across the room and heads towards it
None of the rest of the coterie sees anything glowing
Agree to go check it out together
Small 5 year-old boy trying to pick up books and put them back on the shelves - hands pass straight through the books
Andrea says hello
Boy doesn't register
Carlo asks what Andrea is seeing - he describes the scene
- Carlo: Should we help him?
- Salamah: How? We can't see him
- Carlo: We could pick up books...?
Andrea picks up a book - boy's eyes follow the book as Andrea puts the book onto a shelf
Andrea gets the gut sensation that this was the WRONG THING
Boy flies into a rage as Andrea tries to move the book to a different shelf
Room temperature drops, frost starts forming on the floor just off from Andrea
Salamah hears an unearthly wail - afraid, but not fear-frenzy
Books start hurtling through the air at everyone, they skitter off the skin
Second volley of books - Carlo ends up dodging so fast he can just grab all of the books as they fly through the air
- Neatly stacks all of the books next to the boy's spirit
- The temperature in the room returns to the chilly side of normal
- Carlo experiences a resurgence of rebellion
The coterie decides to look at the books without touching them
Andrea and Salamah end up split off from Sorin and Carlo
- Sorin is feeling territorial and is lost in distinctly NOT his territory
- Carlo spent 2 minutes looking at books and then forgot that he had suggested this and decided to rebel against Andrea who had obviously been the one to suggest it

Andrea and Salamah
- No interesting Tremere books around
- Nothing to do with the Book of Nod or the Revelations of the Dark Mother
- No books of ritual or magic or anything of that nature
- Have no idea where Carlo and Sorin went

Sorin
- Out by reception desk
- Goes to stomp around in the basement
- Walks into a gargoyle
	- It was just standing there

Carlo
- In a room he doesn't understand
- Angry at Andrea's recklessness and then telling him what to do, so he looks for fire sigils
- Something happened while my discord froze
- There's a book with sigils on it - of course Carlo is going to read it
- Suggestion of a lock, but not much more
- Carlo takes out a knife and cuts the leather by the lock to open it
- Lightning book (typo for lightning bolt, but I'm leaving it)
- Loud sound alerts Andrea and Salamah

Sorin
- Gargoyle begins to turn its head
- Sorin changes shape - wheee vicissitude!

Game End
