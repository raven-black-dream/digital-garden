- Andrea knocks and waits for her to finish
	- Before he knocks she hears him and invites him in
- Carlo (Herald) said there was court in 2 hours
- Marcus has Things to talk about
- Andrea doesn't need to feed, so he leaves Lucia to her prayers
- Returns to the manor, changes into slightly fancy clothes for court

Carlo
- At the d'Este estate
- Borso is sleeping in a chair next to Carlo's bed
	- Arms wrapped around his longsword
- Kicks the chair leg lightly, Borso wakes
- Note for Carlo - he reads it - summons to court
- Borso thought the d'Este estate would be rattier with no one living in it for 40 years
	- Andrea has been caring for it - does a good job
- Carlo tells Borso to get some rest
- Borso trains with ghouls - they're good
- Carlo heads out to let Borso get some sleep
- Carlo gets ready and then goes to Elysium early

Salamah
- Sleeping at the university
	- In a barren storeroom, only her and her contact have keys
- Meditates to reconnect with the Abyss
- Gets dressed, goes to the library
- Outside the library doors there's an extremely large grey and black dog with a scroll in its mouth - looking pointedly at Salamah
- Wolf chucks the scroll at Salamah
- She picks it up and asks if she may pass or if the scroll is a riddle she must answer
- Wolf rolls its eyes and steps to the side, barks at her hand
- Salamah opens the scroll as she moves towards the library - same summons as Carlo - attendance not optional
- She thanks the 'large dog' and goes into the library

Sorin
- Sleeps in a dug out space under his ghoul's building
	- Crate of dirt from home
	- Also some dirt in a pouch around his neck
- Balc is waiting for Sorin when he emerges
- Balc had an owl throw a scroll at him
- Sorin speaks a little Italian
- Sorin takes the note and reads it - Same summons
- Talks business with Balc - it's good - Florentines like things from afar
- Sorin starts to stretch - unnatural movements and epic cronchy noises - Balc stares on in horrid fascination as per usual
- Streets are still somewhat busy
- Sorin goes out looking for food - very successful - finds a large brawny man on his own
	- Looking for a fight
	- Wins that fight (obviously)
	- Feeds (1 hunger)
- Elysium is beneath Santa Croce
- Sorin "freshens" his face so it doesn't look like he's just been hit
- Heads towards Elysium

Andrea
- Heads to court after getting ready - but takes a circuitous route through the catacombs

Carlo
- What is Carlo doing at Elysium before court?
	- Wants to talk to Giotto (Sheriff) - what's going on in court and why is it mandatory
	- Prince has mandated that unsanctioned violence at all is heavily frowned upon
- Elysium has changed in 40 years
	- Used to be a more bar-like atmosphere
	- Now a cathedral of bones (ossuary)
	- Now halfway between a chapel and a hastily organized socialization space
- Finds Giotto standing awkwardly looking around with a goblet of blood in his hands
- Carlo suggests sending ghouls in to change the decor
- Maybe don't actively piss off the new Keeper
- Giotto knows that the Prince met with the primogen council last night
	- Guido's been walking around antsy ever since
- Alessandra is out of town
- Giotto drains the goblet, and walks off
- Carlo sits and waits for more people to arrive

Salamah
- Manages to not really get distracted, and squeezes in as the last person before court starts

Group
- People begin to start filtering in after Carlo waits awhile
- Sorin walks in
	- Romanian man wearing a bumpy coat/cloak
	- Eyes dart around - taking note of everything
- Shortly after Andrea will enter court himself

	- Clothing is a decade or two out of date
- Salamah slips in at the last minute
	- Super bright clothes
	- Basically shadow underneath - super dark skin

	- Wearing the robes of a Roman senator
	- Many metres of white fabric with a broad Tyrian purple stripe

- Marcus ends court and leaves
- Carlo heads for Salamah as Andrea heads for Sorin

- Andrea offers space in the estate and to show Salamah (and probably Sorin) to Nico's library

Old Elysium and Pietro's office

- Asks to speak to Andrea and Carlo first, leaves Sorin and Salamah near the main doors
- Last time Carlo was here he was holding a dying Leonello in his arms
- Neither Marcus nor Pietro trust the asylum seekers - could be plants, both from clans that now lead the Sabbat
- How closely should they be watched? - report any wrongdoing or issues
- Now to greet our new friends with smiles - return to the others
- Thanks us for our patience, been a long time since he spoke with the two of them

	- Sorin points out the spots she missed
	- Offers to maybe help her some time
	- Discussion of their homelands and their entry into Florence
- Pietro tells us why we've been brought together
	- A means of being introduced to the city - guides, people we know, etc.
	- Through working together as a coterie - gain status and notoriety within the city
	- Name the coterie the Seekers
	- First task - to seek out the text that Veronica encoded her notes with
- Salamah asks whether she's allowed to roam the city now
	- She is - don't leave her coterie mates unaware of her location, but they are not her jailers
- Andrea asks about the current state of decryption
	- Know it's a book cypher - text is replaced with page:line:word numbers
	- Provides a large leather folio that has reams of paper in it
- Discussion of Florence's history and 'abd - who Salamah admits to knowing and he's the reason she's in the city
