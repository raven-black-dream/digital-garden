Recap
Tour of the library is completed
Andrea put the letter away, and began looking through the notes
- First pages are an itemized inventory of what was at Veronica's place
- She had a lot of art
- There are reams and reams of pages in the notes
Maria asks if Andrea has anything else
- Asks her to let Luca know that Andrea and probably the others will be staying at the estate
- Maria will be busy until daybreak, but will let him know
Salamah is taking out a couple of books - due back in 28 days
As they leave to head to the estate, the door slams - Salamah's shadow slammed it
Salamah makes a comment under her breath and the shadow rips the hood of her cloak off and throws it down the hallway
Salamah curses at the shadow and retrieves her hood, but her shadow stays with the group
- Apologies and small explanation
- Sorin knows some Lasombra through his sire who was very supportive of the Sabbat
- Carlo asks whether the Prince knows - he does, there was an incident during her first meeting
	- How did it happen? Salamah talks of studying the Abyss and the consequences of that
	- Asks if maybe there's a better way of communicating with it - can it write? No idea

Arrive at the estate
- Andrea says to make ourselves at home
- Luca comes down the stairs - introductions
- Kid runs down the stairs, leaps into Andrea's arms - Uncle Andrea!
	- Kid's name is Andrea - sure that makes Andrea Prime super comfy
- Salamah backs up towards the wall
- Luca asks about our clans in order to 'ensure the larder is stocked'
	- Andrea tells him, but says we probably won't be eating there
	- Luca - schooled in all the etiquette - says that guests should be able to eat where they're staying
	- Sorin and Salamah state their restrictions
	- Kid is somewhat scared/nervous of Salamah
	- Luca takes Andrea the small and leaves
- Salamah asks Andrea to warn the staff about her shadow
	- Asks if there's a room away from the mortal staff, is given directions
	- She warns that kine often don't react well to her presence
		- Apologizes for scaring the kid, "the young are often resilient"
	- Goes upstairs to put the books away
- Sorin asks for a room to work somewhat out of the way - is given the room closest to Salamah
- Andrea is going over the notes on Veronica's haven
	- Finds the inventory of Veronica's library - none of the books worked for the cypher
	- Some books marked as sketchbooks
- Carlo goes to wake Borso so he can be introduced to Salamah and Sorin
	- Borso sleeps wrapped around his sword all the time
	- Once he wakes up, Carlo takes him down the hall
- Salamah makes Borso uneasy with her presence, but Carlo introduces them
- They exchange uneasy greetings, then Carlo takes Borso to meet Sorin
	- Sorin comments on Borso's slightly more developed right arm (he's a right-handed swordsman)
- Carlo lets Borso go back to bed - Borso thinks Salamah is super creepy and Sorin is less so, but cordial enough
- Andrea still going over the notes
	- Detailed notes
		- Investigators have gone through every book on her bookshelves
- Carlo enters and offers to help
- Salamah and Sorin return downstairs and Andrea talks about the notes
- Andrea and Salamah go to talk about the Catacombs
	- Salamah describes sensing the Abyss and that it felt familiar, knows of Paulo's history
	- Andrea says it was where the Lasombra made their home base when they came to take the throne
		- Asks whether it's a new connection or an old one
	- Salamah is unsure and would have to study it further
		- She feels like it is a stable connection, but isn't sure why. It doesn't feel like a fresh wound
		- Doesn't feel as though it is untraversed - it's been used in the last 40 years
	- Andrea asks why she left Milan
		- Disagreed with the politics and the direction the Lasombra were taken
		- Asks if it was difficult to leave
			- Easy to leave at first, she was on good terms with the Cainites of the city
			- Difficult to stay hidden until she came to Florence
			- They may be able to sense her if they're watching, and Andrea has an idea that they are still intermittently watching the city
- Andrea goes to talk to Luca
- Salamah goes back to help with the notes

Studying the notes
- Veronica has a ton of art
- Penchant for mythological figures
- Penchant for artists' early works

Sorin is done getting acquainted with the space, when he gets up a young woman pokes her head in and asks if he needs anything
- Asks where the others are and goes to join them

Andrea goes to talk to Luca
- Mentions Salamah's shadow and that she and Sorin are in their respective rooms
- He will be staying at the estate but any staff who need to be elsewhere can go to the manor

Andrea goes to talk to Lucia
- Asks about her night and how she got the letter
	- She describes how she followed all of them and while they were in Pietro's office a man came up and asked her to deliver the letter
		- He has really dark eyes
	- Andrea describes Francesco and asks if the description matches - it does
	- Andrea keeps pushing for details and Lucia keeps saying he said nothing important
	- Andrea asks whether he said she couldn't talk about him, but he didn't
	- Andrea would like to contact Francesco, but there's no contact information in the letter

Andrea returns to the estate
Carlo had tried to make small talk with Salamah, but she's on scholarly autopilot and he gives up
Not a lot of progress made - there are no books in Veronica's haven that were used in the cypher
Andrea, Salamah, and Sorin are kind of into the notes, Carlo is bored and suggests they go to Veronica's haven to have a look
- Andrea asks whether he thinks they missed something in the inventory
- He states that there wasn't a fresco when he was there
- The coterie decides it's worth taking a look at

Carlo leads the coterie to Veronica's haven
Two Brujah guards outside
They got a note saying that the coterie was allowed in

Veronica's Haven
- Very chic place - showing off her wealth in how the place is decorated
- If a wall doesn't have paintings on it, it has frescos
- Many early sketches

Go to Veronica's bedroom
- Room is built around a huge bed
- Small seating area
- They brought a lantern and as it bathes the ceiling in light we see the fresco
	- Two lovers trysting
	- Female looking up at the night sky, clearly enjoying herself
	- His lips are smeared red, glistening in the moonlight
- Carlo definitely does not remember the fresco, but he recognizes Veronica
- Deductions
	- If she commissioned the fresco, it had to be a Cainite because a mortal would've needed light during the day to do this, in her bedroom
	- Carlo maybe just doesn't remember the fresco
	- Maybe she speed-painted it on her last night
	- Maybe it was painted after her death - then wouldn't the investigators know
- Carlo goes looking around the rest of the place - many spicy sculptures and paintings
- Carlo asks if Sorin or Salamah are good artists
	- Sorin: Not in traditional mediums
