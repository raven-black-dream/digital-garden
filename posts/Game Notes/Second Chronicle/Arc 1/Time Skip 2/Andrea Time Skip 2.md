City
1 - In the first night of the timeskip, he'd visit Carlo's city guard.
"How many of the last few weeks' victims were you able to identify?"
"Did you interview their relations to get background or anything? Will someone check on them / have they already?"

A1.A: "Some not all, many of them were too messed up to be able to identify. The whole thing has been a little difficult to investigate"

A1.B: "Again some of them, there wasn't a lot of information that they were able to give, other than where they were going etc. There didn't seem to be any real patterns in the people who were targeted." (Will follow-up when Andrea has things to say/questions to ask)

Follow up: "Thank you for your work. It makes sense with what we know now that there wasn't much of a pattern. How were those that you did talk to? Were any in dire straights?" 
~~story teller discretion here of if you feel like having an Andrea-pokes-his-nose-into-more-mortals-lives storyline or not, answer accordingly and move to 2 if yes :)~~ doesn't pursue further

~~2 - Depending on answers to 1, and if there are people he thinks should be checked in on more: "Borso, would you go with Lucia to check on the murdered's relations? I feel like she could use some backup and it makes the most sense to go during the day when I can't be there. And I know you're Carlo's ghoul, so before you wonder why you should care, let me present it to you this way. Desperate people with nothing to lose will do desperate things. Their relations were supernaturally murdered and we don't want those desperate things to be hunting for answers. Think of it like preemptively protecting Carlo from people looking for answers or bringing the inquisition back."~~

A2: 

-----

Francesco
1 - What's Francesco up to? Does Andrea hear back after the letter he left in the last time skip?

A3: Francesco would likely reply to Andrea's letter. I will just need to think about what is included in that letter. I will get to it before I leave.

-----

Guidobaldo
1 - What protections were put in place against the Lasombra? 


A4: Short answer: Holding cells designed specifically for them. A Scourge who has very little trouble ferreting them out, and a neighbouring Gangrel who helped oust them the first time.

Followup: out-of-character question - is there something that makes 'abd particularly good at finding Lasombra?

2 - What does Guidobaldo want in return for the info? (Lucia said he considered her help a personal favour from Andrea, does he count this against that?)

A5: He does want something, it will be a small favour in the future. Likely similar in nature, providing information. 

Follow up: sounds good, will write down a minor boon

3 - Any other details that Andrea can get from Guidobaldo? 

A6: Would need ideas for what sorts of things Andrea might want to know.

Follow up: Things like who the Lasombra were, what the city was like while they were there, what happened to them / if any of them still exist

-----

Hans/Hugo
1 - I want more interactions with Hans in ways that tell me how he reacts to the supernatural world he's now in. To that end I have contrived at least one plausible scenario for such an interaction. XD 

Andrea, after they've settled in a while, and now with the inquisition top of mind again, would introduce them to the manor, to the escape route there, and to the catacombs. "I would recommend you don't come down here unless necessary, and ideally not by yourself. But if it's humans that you're trying to escape from, there are some pretty good emergency routes through here. I'll show you the couple you should know just in case."

A7: Hans would be pretty okay with this. He would likely think better of Andrea, seeing him as having some tactical sense. etc. They both might find the catacombs a little tight, and uncomfortable. But, can see them as a solid choke point. I think that one of them would likely ask what is down that way (pointing at the direction which only goes to Ernst's chapel). You are welcome to do with that what you'd like. Further information incoming when you have commentary

Follow up: *player-happy-squee re Hans reaction* XD
"Down that way is my ...family's... private chapel. There are emergency supplies there."

-----

Luca
1 - How's Luca doing after his vacation? 

A8: Likely still a bit tired. But, looking a bit more refreshed. Perhaps a little happier. 

Follow up: Yay! 
...and then he get's to deal with the coterie again... XD

2 - If he has time, there should be more medical studies with Andrea.

A9: Sure, that would be a good idea

Follow up: Probably spending the xp on a dot of medicine if there's been enough training in the timeskip then.

Sounds good to me

3 - Andrea's going to ask (a while after the vacation) about looking for replacements for some of the semi-retired staff. Franco (64) and Alfonso (65) are probably next to retire. Perhaps a different demographic than foreign mercenaries this time though Luca. I don't want the entire staff to be Hans and Hugo-like, they should probably be balanced out a bit.

A10: Luca would set out the CVs of the other applicants from the last time that he put a call out for hires. There may be some responses in there that would appeal to Andrea. But Luca would ask, what sort of staff are we looking to hire with this influx of people? Are we hiring for the proverbial larder?

Follow up: Whatever Franco and Alfonso were doing are what Andrea is thinking to hire "for". 
"*cringe* Luca, please find another word. Yes new hires would help spread the load of sustaining the coterie but..." *falls silent as he flips through the pile of papers for a while then pulls out a few*
"How about some of these letters?" *mutters* "I don't really care if they match Sorin's requirements"
(I'm thinking 2 or 3 younger people to replace Franco/Alfonso; not necessarily brawny males as per Sorin, but more of a demographic mix so the entire staff doesn't become a mercenary troupe, possibly 1 or 2 more mercanaries as I assume that will be the majority of the previous applicants and 1 more domestic worker)

I will make the assumption that there is a burly person, then 2 domestic workers.

4 - Andrea would have been the one driving the rebuild of the manor, but leaning on Luca heavily for logistics. He might ask Luca's opinion on fortifying / securing the estate better with the inquisition top of mind. (Fireproofing? Emergency exits?)

A11: "Where we are it would be a lot harder to fortify this place. We are in the centre of a busy area of the city. It would be harder to justify here. Maybe your "Family" can help with setting up a direct access to the catacombs from here? I am not sure though." 

Follow up: I think that's something Andrea would definitely like at some point. How far away is the closest connection to the catacombs? He might try to have staff slowly dig from the cellar/basement (assuming there is one?) if it is not terribly far, or may try to ask (as Luca suggests) one of the Nosferatu builders for a minor boon if it is a larger project. I feel like he would like the ability to slip directly into the catacombs from either of his havens even outside of emergency situations.

5 - How are the general finances doing? It having been 40 years since inheriting from Ernst, and getting whatever they could salvage from Giovanna's sire's estate, how are the businesses doing now? (Either in terms of resources as the book puts it, or additional staff / herd that he'd be able to hire and maintain for the coterie, or in terms of other general things he could do with the resources.) 

A12: I have basically been assuming that if the coterie needed finances it wasn't a problem. The businesses are doing well, they were well established and run by very competant people.

Follow up: Excellent. This is mostly to check that things like slowly increasing the size of the staff is reasonable financially.

Yes. Yes it is. 

-----

Luca/Maria/Little Andrea
1 - Perhaps at some point during the timeskip he'd go to Luca's place and say hi to everyone - it's been a while now since little Andrea used to be roaming around the estate/manor. Maybe at the month-change as part of usual reghouling interactions with Luca/Maria.

A13: Is there anything that you'd like to know about that visit?

Follow up: Partly he's trying to check in on Little Andrea - time passing "means more" to a like 6 or 7 year old than a frozen-in-time-cainite, so if Andrea hasn't seen the boy in months... or if he didn't visit for years... things change, and the last time he saw the boy was when he got freaked out by Salamah.
Partly Andrea would like to have some time with a bit "more human" company, away from the context of the estate and the coterie.

Noted

-----

Lucia
1 - Now that the shade's done and the inquisition's dealt with for now, and having recently been sort of blindsided by her learning Awe, and Luca's warnings that something seems off with her recently, Andrea's probably trying to keep a bit more of an eye on what she's up to and spend a bit more time with her.

A14: She would be quite enthusiastically in support of this.

Follow up: heheheh that's good XD

2 - "<to Lucia when he wakes up the next morning that she's there> So, why _did_ you choose Awe to learn, and why ask Guidobaldo?" "Well, if you're going that route, you really should get a bit better at acting. We should practice that." Possibly working on acting together. Probably away in the manor cellar.

A15: "I heard that he was remarkably cool tempered for a Brujah, and I wasn't sure which other clan might have the ability to teach me."

3 - Poking a bit more at who she owes things to / who owes her now that he knows she's doing that. Asking in more indirect ways and worked into other conversations as opposed to "give me a complete accounting now".

A16: She owes Nico a boon, which he hasn't called in yet, and is continuing to do errands for Guidobaldo.

-----

Nico
1 - We never played out Andrea asking Nico about where he got the Tremere books... What does he say about them if Andrea asks in the timeskip?

A "They just sort of appeared one night. I am not sure who donated, them. But, later I received instructions from Pietro to store them in the former Prince's Library. Theoretically, that instruction came from the Prince? But, who is to know for sure."

Follow up: "hmm. Odd. Thank you, I suppose I should ask Pietro about it then..." (wonders if 'abd dropped them off but doesn't voice that) (Yes, 'abd did drop them off)
Add this to the list of things that he asks Pietro about at some point. Depending on what Pietro responds with, Andrea may investigate further / elsewhere.

-----

Nosferatu
1 - Go check on the caved tunnel area, perhaps go say hi to some Nosferatu contacts and see how they're doing (incl Leonello?).  

They're doing alright, the tunnel is reinforced, some suspicion around Andrea being there without a distinct errand.

-----

Pietro

1 - Update on activities, see also Sorin section

2 - How would one contact another Cainite city in this time? Is there some sort of city-to-city mail through Heralds or between Princes? Is it all personal, like if someone wants to talk to someone in another city they go themselves / send a ghoul? If travelling themselves do they have to ask permission to leave/enter? Andrea would ask Pietro about getting a message to Venice looking for Niccolo if that was an applicable thing to ask the city's Seneschal.

Personal, often sending a ghoul

-----

Sorin
1 - He will be reporting everything he's learned about Sorin to Pietro, ideally when Pietro is in a reasonable / good mood, and seeing what Pietro's responses are.
2 - Andrea reactions to Sorin's recent activities discussion
