### Practical Notes
- Heal 3 Agg over downtime
- Hopefully get my 4 spent willpower back
- Spending XP (I have 17)
	- Level 2 of Oubliette background (4 XP)
	- Working on raising Road Rating - See Narrative Notes re: Moment of Truth and potential XP cost (12 XP, maybe reduced to 6 XP)
	- Working on Vision of Shadow ritual (12 XP) - from Lore of the Clans (p.126) - can maybe get it depending on how much XP we get from this downtime (would need 5 if I get the road rating at reduced XP, so I might get close)

### Narrative Notes

1) Discussing the boon she owes Sorin (TBD - See PC discussions below)
2) Oubliette development
	1) Expanding up to a single room chamber
	2) Checking whether anything/anyone has gotten trapped in it (with the controllable darksight merit I can see within it)
	3) Moment(s) of Truth
		1) I'm wondering if Salamah's time in the cell has the effect of reaffirming her commitment to the Abyss and whether that counts as a Moment of Truth for the purpose of Road development
		2) Alternatively, she will be spending time meditating in her Oubliette once it's a larger room which may also count as a moment of truth, but she'll be doing that either way
3) Discussions with Andrea (TBD - See PC discussions below)
4) The Giovanni
	1) Through my academic contacts (and perhaps their contacts throughout Italy) I would like to try to find Niccolo Giovanni (who sounds like a scholarly type), or, failing that, the family in general in Venice
	2) If either is successful, I'm hoping to get basically any kinds of details that would help us locate and/or talk to them
5) Milan
	1) While OOC I know Vision of Shadow won't work, she wants to try spying on people in Milan with it (range is only 9 miles) - if she gets it during downtime
		1) If there's time and she can get away, she may try it through the Abyssal door in the catacombs
	2) Can we discuss whether I have any contacts or anything in Milan? I never bought any specifically with XP, but maybe my 3 dots of academic contacts are spread out (one in Milan, one in Florence, one maybe still in Granada or somewhere else more relevant? Or maybe you have a better idea)
	3) See also academic contacts
7) 'Abd
	1) Salamah is going to start sending notes to 'Abd
	2) Content TBD
8) Pietro
	1) Continuing to spy on him with small Abyssal shadows
9) Academic Contacts
	1) Continue cultivating my academic contacts - doing research work for them on an ad hoc basis
	2) Also, if they have their own contacts in Milan, Rome, or Sicily, I would appreciate any strange news, or political information from those areas
		1) Mostly just keeping a finger on the pulse of those cities and, by doing so, the Sabbat in Milan, the Inquisition in Rome, and the Lasombra stronghold in Sicily.
		2) OOC: I'm not expecting anything highly actionable

### PC Discussions
#### Andrea
1) Initial What is going on? Conversation

A: Pulls Salamah aside the next night and is sort of like 'hey, what you said about the Lasombra and the inquisition yesterday, you're not usually that blunt, what's going on?'  

S: Salamah sighs “I have been experiencing some difficulty since my meeting with the Prince. He refused to leave our conversation to chance and preemptively forced my compliance so I would answer his questions honestly. I believe I am experiencing some side effects of that exchange.”

A: That is... interesting. Potentially dangerous. {pensive pause} For both you personally and the coterie and city more broadly. I know you'd said your religion was a topic that could put you in danger, and really, lies or at least hiding the truth of vampires' existence from mortals are the foundation of our safety...

Can you just omit things or not answer?

S: I have tried, and it is difficult, but not impossible. Not guaranteed either, however.

A: Does it put you in danger if I ask something like why you really came to this city? I assume the Prince would have thoroughly satisfied himself on that count, and you wouldn't still be here if your reasons were against the city.

S: Put me in danger? Not particularly. Put you in danger? Depends on what you do with the information. {looks uncomfortable} “*Are* you asking why I really came to this city?”

A: Andrea will nod slowly for all the first part. For the ‘it wont put her in danger but it might him’ I think he will look a little confused. I don’t think he has a conclusion to jump to as to why that would be. Unless it’s a threat. Or him getting dragged into Lasombra drama or something. 

Most conclusions would mean that the safe thing to do would be to not ask. But… I dunno that he’d do the “safe” thing with info at his fingertips. 
  
Maybe something like “why would knowing why you came to the city put me in danger?” {narrows eyes slightly} “Is that a threat from you, or a statement that danger follows you?”

S: Salamah will roll her eyes before she can stop herself and say "I said it depends on what you do with the information. I have known Cainites to be just as curious as you with, I believe, less self-control or perhaps just more interest in their own political position. Should you, for instance, wish to try and solve my situation, or even simply investigate it, you may knock over the precariously built safety mechanisms currently in place."

She sighs "I realize that in talking circles I make myself sound more suspicious, and I will tell you if you wish to know - I cannot stop if you ask as we both know - but in return I ask that you do nothing with the information unless you discuss it with me first."

A: Andrea with a nod “Okay, deal. That sounds fair. I’ll consult you if I think action needs to be taken on the matter. So… why did you come to Florence?”

S: “I mostly spoke the truth before. I left due to politics. I simply did not mention several details. Florence wasn’t my intended goal, it was my only option in a sea of bad options. To explain, I need to start earlier. I don’t know how much Cainite history you know, but my path traverses some of the recent big moments.

I was embraced in Granada, it was a good city for Lasombra, particularly those of the Ashirra - the practitioners of Islam. Until the Christian Inquisition came, that is. But it was there that I met ‘abd, after he left Florence for some time away after the Lasombra and Giovanna. He wasn’t so…militant then, but he was very guarded. We had talked, bonded over our shared faith and similar beliefs, and then he left - presumably to return to Florence. He had only mentioned what had happened here briefly, with no real detail. When the Muslims began being ousted from the city a couple decades later, I left as well. Travel as a Cainite is difficult, but I had some help, and heard that there were Abyss Mystics in Milan. I didn’t know that they were connected to what had happened in Florence, not then. I just wanted to learn and to continue my studies in peace.

However, in the meantime the Lasombra outside of the Ashirra were supposedly diablerizing Lasombra {she looks a little skeptical here}, finding new allies and inciting the revolts. Perhaps those in the Ashirra as well, but I admit I was less interested in politics then than I am in Carlo’s love life now, so I did not pay as much attention as I maybe should have. The Convention of Thorns was a turning point, but that was the year I was leaving Granada, it was not something I was concerned with. The Lasombra, along with the Tzimisce and a few other clans, formed the Sabbat.

Things were okay for a few years. Nothing really seemed to change except in name - Milan didn’t have a Prince, they had an Archbishop, we didn’t form coteries, we had packs. This so-called Sabbat was basically just the Camarilla under different leadership and with, I’ve come to find, fewer human morals.

Slowly new ideas came in. A ritual aspect began to be added to everything we did. Packs gained priests, basically our pack leaders, and aside from the very Catholic feel things were taking on, I still only felt vaguely uncomfortable, but I could see where things were heading.

The politics began devolving into talk of war - perhaps it was always there, but when once it was whispers, now it was screams of the threat of tyranny and control from the Camarilla. They were starting to embrace mortals without thought or conviction, simply to have soldiers. I had no interest in being subject to or forced into another jyhad, nevermind one that did not reflect my own experience or desires. So I began to plan my exit.  

Here, in Florence, were you to choose to leave you would be allowed - pending permission to travel in other lands, yes?

While I would theoretically be allowed to leave Milan, I had doubts I would be simply allowed to defect from the Sabbat, though I hadn’t truly chosen to join except due to convenience. The night I chose to leave was the night they tried to bind me to my pack. {she shudders} The Sabbat practice a Tzimisce ritual known as the Vaulderie, which breaks blood oaths and creates new bonds. I don’t know much about it, but I refuse to be kept against my will again. So I made flimsy excuses, but I knew my time was limited. I left, with no plans in place and no one to turn to.

Except ‘abd. Or so I hoped. I knew he had come from a city that seemed to accept him, one that had a Prince who was independent enough to not care about what other cities were doing. One who was strong enough to protect me by simply existing. I sent letters. I leant on our shared faith, citing Zakat, or charity to the needy. I offered everything I could think of, information about Milan primarily since I was already going to be seen as a traitor. I begged for safe haven. I *begged.* Lasombra do not beg, but I set aside my ego in the name of survival. I heard from contacts in Milan that they had been called to the Wild Hunt. Do you know what that is? {regardless of answer she simply continues as she’s getting heated now and words are just spilling from her - Andrea is likely not sure if it’s the side effects or just that she’s kept it bottled up for so long - she starts pacing}. I suppose in the Camarilla it’s better known as a Blood Hunt. More civilized too, from what I understand, but no less traumatizing if ‘abd is any indication. It’s what they do to traitors. I was to be hunted by my own kind until I was captured, then tortured until they deigned to give me my Final Death. Along with anyone who helped me or knew about my treachery. {Sudden slightly guilty look at Andrea, with a hint of ‘see, this is what I was talking about’}

So I did it *for* them. I had help, by then ‘abd had agreed to speak for me to Marcus, and I’d found some sympathetic Cainites who weren’t devout Sabbat followers willing to follow through with the charade. Part of the plan was some judicious use of memory modification abilities, which means I can’t reach out and learn the results. However, based on the fact that I’m still here, and have not discovered any assassination attempts, I would bet that the Sabbat in Milan currently believes I am dead. And yes, Marcus knows this, it’s likely the only reason he’s allowed me to remain here, though I’m not sure he fully believes the story. He has made it clear I’m on thin ice anyway. {Collapses into a seat, seems exhausted, would likely cry from stress if she were mortal}

((OOC: for this last speech, I did roll Willpower at different points - since this was right after last game I was rolling 4 dice - results as follows:
- Threshold at start = 3 - Successes = 3 - just to see if she could control it as she was planning on starting with the truth and maybe just omitting things
- Threshold as she begins to talk about Milan/getting a little more emotional: 4 - Successes = 2 - welp, here comes the truth
- Threshold as she starts talking about the Hunt: 4 or 5 - Successes = 1 - hmm, yes, streamrolling the conversation because she cannot stop herself))

A: (OOC: What’s the cainite equivalent of ‘hug her cause she is clearly exhausted and stressed’? He knows not to actually touch her cause library, but whatever the cainite equivalent of ‘show sympathy and comfort’ is.)

Perhaps sit down next to her. “Thank you. {short pause} Things make a bit more sense now… That will be why the alley frenzies freaked you out so much… {almost as an afterthought} Sorry about that. My bond to Carlo seems to be fading a bit and should be gone soon.” {shrugs} Longer pause then slightly guarded tone: “I didn’t really want to mention it to anyone in the coterie, but with the blood hunt… you should know. {another sigh cause he doesn’t like giving information for “free” but it seems fair / sort of part of the deal at this point} You remember that first night in the city, when I grabbed Lucia from following behind me? She’d been given a letter from Milan. It predates you {hurriedly adds} and I haven’t and won’t mention you. But… I know they are surveilling the city. {turns to watch her} That shadow door we found is active. I don’t know how it works, and they _shouldn’t_ be in the city, but sometimes… sometimes should and reality don’t line up.”

S: She'll flinch slightly when Andrea gets close, but settle quickly and relax a little. She'll nod slowly when Andrea talks about the letter from Milan and the door, saying "I am not entirely surprised" quietly, but not anything more. 

Re: Andrea already being on the list, she'll actually chuckle a bit at that, but it's a sort of wry chuckle "I have no doubt that you are on Paulo's list, but being on one disgraced Lasombra's list is not the same as being on the Sabbat's list. Still, if I am ever taken by them, you have every right to deny my existence or plead ignorance. I certainly will renounce any connection I have to you or the others in this city. If I am to die by their hands, I will endeavor to die alone."

A: If she doesn’t reply he’ll switch to “The embracing mortals simply for soldiers in horrifying. But I have also come across the worst version of that already from Paulo.” In a very steely tone “I have no doubt that they would torture someone past the point of insanity before killing them… you looked a bit guilty on the anyone who helped you likely being added to the hunt. {slight huff} If they cared about me and had a list I would probably already be on it from 40 years ago.” He’ll shrug and get up. “I have no interest in aiding their ilk. You are still welcome in my haven of course, and I’ll do what I can to hide you.” “One other thing I wanted to ask you. What do you think of Sorin? Do you know anything about him beyond the coterie interactions?”

S: As Andrea turns the conversation to Sorin, Salamah will sharpen her focus a bit, "I have mixed feelings about Sorin. On the one hand, he is an academic, like me, and I respect that. On the other, he is Tzimisce, and while I have no true issues with the clan, it is their sorcerers who created the Vaulderie. I have observed Sorin enough to guess that he is not a sorcerer. He is also secretive, which does not surprise me {slight pause} You are angry with him though, since we found his working space in the chantry, why is that?

A: Andrea will laugh too at being on just one Lasombra’s list. “It makes me quite happy he is disgraced now.” At being asked why Andrea is angry with Sorin, he’ll look surprised. “I thought that was obvious. You saw just as well what Sorin was up to as I did. That man on the table who was trying to scream? He’d obviously been there a while. Sorin had sealed his mouth shut. Where’d he get that mortal from? _Where did he get that Schlachta from?_ He seems to think it is just fine to abduct and malform humans. {Andrea bristles}”

S: Salamah will nod, "I assumed that was the case, but is it not simply his nature? Would you be angry with a cat for tormenting its food, a rat for behaving selfishly, or a snake for striking a human who disturbed it?"

A: Andrea will glare back “He ought to know better, he used to be human. He’s certainly not acting in self defense. Look, I understand we have different paths and morals. But how would you like to be left strapped to a table with your mouth removed? You’ve got to be able to see how terrifying that would be for a person even if you personally excuse it as his nature.”

S: Salamah will actually look at Andrea with sadness and a bit of pity "Sorin has not been human for a long time, neither have I, nor you. He likely does not recognize mortal fear as a valid emotion anymore. I am not saying he is correct in his {pause} activities. Simply that, like an animal he does not understand. Being angry will not change him. Nor will it help you except to fuel your own feelings of righteous superiority. If you want him to stop, or change, you either must stop him, or teach him, but anger will only cause him to be more secretive"

A: So maybe a sort of deflated flop response - I am not trying to make Sorin more secretive. But I don’t know how to explain to him that humans are… human… if he doesn’t remember. Perhaps at that point a long silence and then the bit about her asking questions if you wanted.
