### Game Start

Recap
Carlo downtime (pre-[[Game 11]])
- Guard investigating - not doing very well
	- Been able to keep the supernatural aspect of the assailant hidden (he thinks more or less) (Rolled 5 successes on his roll to keep things quiet.)
- Asks to meet the guard the following week to see if there are any other interesting tidbits
- Training with Borso mainly
- May go and train with the Brujah if his sire isn't there
	- At one point when he's there he'll notice a shadow sneaking away from Guidobaldo's office - not sure there was anything really there (Lucia)

Sorin - working on his Szlachta
- Brought down extra food
- Didn't take as long as he thought to get it to a reasonable working state
- Has some extra "resources" in his "supply cupboard"

Salamah
- Can separate the two parts of the ritual so long as she can keep her mind on the separate parts
- Goes in search of food - finds a burly guy, she has no idea who he is, maybe a mercenary/body guard type person (Medici Personal Bodyguard - is not doing well (1 success on his roll to be alright))
- Heals and feeds
- Heads back to the estate - tells Andrea that the ritual can work the way they hope it will

Andrea
- Notes for staff
- Talk to Lucia - take a note to Guidobaldo - she seems slightly flustered
	- Andrea is suspicious/concerned
	- Lucia is trying to be cute and not reveal what's wrong
	- She's trying to use Awe - fails
	- Andrea knows she was trying to do something - gets super suspicious and calls her out on it
	- She admits to trying to use a discipline on him
	- Andrea pulls Lucia into another room
	- Lucia admits that she used Awe on the mortal that Salamah terrified
		- Took him to Nico to re-write his memory
		- Mortal isn't going Malkavian at all
		- Lucia owes Nico a boon or two
	- Lucia had approached Guidobaldo to teach her Presence
		- He appreciated her ambition and bravery
		- She's been running errands for him for a while
		- Still owes him
	- Andrea tells her to not use Awe on him again
		- She agrees - Yes Master - she does not usually refer to him in that way
		- Andrea looks at her sharply again as he can hear what she said
	- Both giving eachother questioning looks and silence
	- Andrea asks whether there's anything else he should know about
	- Lucia admits to telling Luca that Andrea had said to take some time off
		- It was a conversation, not a note?
		- There was a note from someone else - which now Andrea has to investigate
	- Andrea is now distracted by this, but Lucia stands and waits
	- After a long pause, Andrea starts to ask Lucia to give the note to Guidobaldo when she next sees him, but then realizes he should ask about what the errands are
		- Mostly just running messages
	- Lucia asks how secretive she should be
		- This note is not super secretive
		- Probably don't advertise additional disciplines

Salamah returns to the estate
- Tells Andrea the results of the experiments - success!
- They decide to find a space in the merchant quarter that will work for the trap
- Go to find Carlo since he probably knows the merchant quarter better than they do

Carlo and Borso are sparring - Borso is moving at Celerity speeds
Salamah watches their sparring with interest
- Italian swordsmanship
- They're fantastic - particularly Carlo, Borso is keeping up
Andrea calls out for them, but they're so used to it that they don't really respond
Once a particular round is done, they turn their attention to Andrea and Salamah
Andrea says that we should head out to the merchant quarter to find a spot for the trap
Carlo says to give him 20 minutes to pack up
Borso swings a sneaky strike at Carlo's back - he parries it with his bare hand
Salamah laughs and follows Andrea inside

Merchant's Quarter
- Looking for a ritual space
- Not a best case scenario location, nor a worst case scenario
	- Find top two or three locations with varying degrees of terribleness in case of emergency
	- Carlo insists on a particular "super quiet alley" that happens to be right near his kin - unbeknownst to the rest of us
- Head back to the estate confident in our choice(s)

Dawn breaks on Florence [[10-22-1515]]

Mortals going about their business
- A young girl jogging through the streets in the early morning trying to get home
- A strong built man speaking to a Slavic immigrant before stepping into his shop to begin his day's work
- A couple of white-cloaked priests enter the city
As the day ends people scurry home and lock their doors
Dusk falls

Sorin
- Feeds on one of the people he's got hanging out
- Heads to the estate with the Szlachta

Carlo
- Borso asks whether there's anything he can do for Carlo
	- Carlo says probably not tonight
- Carlo feeds from Borso as Borso is heading off to sleep

Andrea
- Absence of a weight on his chest when he wakes up
	- Lucia is running his message to Guidobaldo and has a few other errands to run
- Leaves a note for Lucia about his plans for the evening
- Goes to find Luca - at his desk as per usual
	- Asks about the note he received, Lucia didn't write it
	- There's something about Lucia that makes Luca uneasy these days
	- He finds the note for Andrea, who looks it over
	- Clearly it's Maria writing a note and signing it from Andrea, but zero success in obfuscating who had written it
	- Andrea tells Luca that Maria had written it - Luca hadn't even noticed despite how obvious it was
	- He asks Andrea what he should do
	- Andrea tells Luca to rest and says to tell Maria to just talk to him (Andrea) instead of forging his name
	- Luca heads out to home

Salamah
- Wakes up, puts hair up, heads to library to wait for the others

Andrea, Carlo and Sorin all arrive in the library
- Burly man with Sorin - proportions are not quite right
- Andrea asks whether Sorin and his "friend" are ready to go
	- Sorin says that yes, it's ready

Coterie heads to the merchant quarters
- While Salamah focuses on the ritual, the others do bodyguarding and general lookouts
- Andrea hears a large family in a nearby courtyard - extended family, very boisterous
	- Hears a woman's voice say 'Where's that loser Carlo?'
- Carlo and Salamah also hear the voices
	- Carlo realizes he knows where they are and freaks out a bit - manages to not frenzy
	- Salamah is hungry - but keeps it down
- Andrea keeps everyone from moving forward and asks Carlo if that's his family
	- Yep
	- Andrea sighs, turns on his heel and says we're going to an actually quiet location
- Carlo follows quietly
- Salamah hesitates, but follows as well
- Head to the site Andrea found - not in Carlo's neighbourhood
- Andrea hears screams from back the way we came - many screams
	- Turns around and takes us back
	- Coterie follows
	- Back into Carlo's neighbourhood
	- Screams coming from that courtyard
- Andrea scales the wall to look into the courtyard
- The shade is attacking, people are in a panic and trying to escape into the house
- A person is on the ground bleeding - the shade has not stopped at one person, can't seem to make up its mind
- Andrea says it's the shade
- Sorin and the Szlachta scale the wall (Szlachta has way too many successes - copies Carlo)
	- Its hood falls back - clear to anyone who is looking (Andrea mostly) one of the hands has been turned into a bone blade
- Carlo vaults the wall and lands on the table
- Salamah manages to scale it eventually
- Carlo looks for his brother, can't find him, tries to tell one of the other members of his family to get people inside, but they're all panicked
	- Swings at the shade - blade bites deep into *something*
	- Probably not what he wanted to hit
