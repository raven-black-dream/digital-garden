### Game Start

Game Recap
- Carlo had a lovely evening
	- Until the screaming
- Lucia had gone up and slapped the screaming man, who got quieter
- None of this is Sorin's problem
- Carlo walks up to observe, but not interfere, prepares to grab the man if he runs off before Lucia lets him
- Andrea enters the manor and asks Luca what happened
	- He has no idea, he didn't even know there was another mortal in the house
	- Andrea asks where Salamah is, and Luca didn't know she was even in the house
- Andrea calls for Salamah and heads towards her room
- Salamah - just puttering around, pokes her head out
- Andrea asks wtf happened
	- Salamah attempts to explain what happened
	- By why is this a problem
	- Tried not to kill the staff
- Sorin walks in
	- More trying to explain what the masquerade is to Salamah
- Carlo walks in
	- The inquisition is bad
- I missed writing down a bunch of the conversation because I was enjoying it so much
- Andrea has more cleanup to do, Salamah may owe Andrea depending on how bad it all is
- Andrea waves Luca over and they walk towards the kitchen
	- May not be safe here anymore - should we move the staff out of the estate?
	- Luca will see what happens with the man, maybe spread a story about him
- Back to the other three
	- Go to check on the hand
	- Library is locked
	- Salamah offers to pick the lock - and does so easily
	- The hand is clearly agitated
		- Slammed a book shut, picked it up, and threw it across the room where it slams into the door frame next to Carlo's head
		- Stomping as it moves
		- Written note - good approximation of Sorin's handwriting, gets more frenzied and agitated as it goes down the page
		- Has little respect for Veronica as an artist
	- Several journal entries have Carlo's name
	- Carlo starts going through a box
	- Sorin returns his hand to his wrist, keeps the eye in the palm
	- Continue research
		- Sorin and Carlo mostly just get the boring, mundane stuff
		- Salamah - reference to a meeting with a friar Niccolo Giovanni
			- Can't find the actual meeting part before day breaks
- Lucia didn't make it back before dawn

Next Day [[10-06-1515]]
- Salamah wakes - Abyss is screaming its hungry rage at her
- Andrea wakes with Lucia there as usual
	- Asks how it went last night
	- Lucia took the man to Nico who worked some magic on him
	- Andrea feeds and Lucia goes to sleep
- Carlo wakes
	- Borso is pissed that Carlo left without saying anything the previous evening
	- Carlo tells Borso to keep an eye on things re: the Inquisition etc.
		- When did Carlo last feed Borso? Probably relatively recently (maybe two weeks? - roll dice or pick a time to kind of keep track)
		- Feeds Borso is a more personal fashion rather than out of a glass or other receptacle
	- Waits to go feed to see what everyone else is doing
- Sorin had asked Balc to keep the daylabourer around at dusk to meet the boss
	- Daylabourer had shown up sober
	- Sorin showed up in bloody/dirty "rough" clothes - Daylabourer keeps his cool
	- Sorin wanted to see 'What kind of man he (the daylabourer) is'
	- Sorin found the daylabouer when the daylabourer was at his lowest, few friends, lost his job, etc. etc.
	- Sorin keeps the guy on, leaves Balc in charge of him
	- Sorin gives Balc vitae
- Salamah wakes up hungry - goes looking for a staff member to feed from
	- Finds an older gentleman - manages to just take one hunger from him
	- Finds another staff member - woman, early twenties - takes 2 hunger from her, she falls unconscious and Salamah moves her to the main area so someone will find her
- Andrea goes looking for Luca - he looks very very tired
	- Luca and Borso canvassed the neighbourhood and found some of the people who heard things the night before, talked them into believing another story
	- Luca has concerns about Lucia
		- She took another mortal into the catacombs, into the Cainite library, to have his brain rewritten and then took him home - and that was her first go-to solution to the problem
		- Also Andrea seemed to have no problem with it
		- Lucia didn't mention any cost for getting the guy's mind wiped
	- Two candidates for staff
		- Andrea asks their names
			- One sounds Greek, one sounds French
		- Luca picked people from further away so they wouldn't necessarily have family nearby in case they go missing
	- Andrea leaves and trips over Cecilia on the floor (the woman Salamah left there)
		- She's still breathing
		- Checks her over to see if she's otherwise okay
		- She's pale and her pulse is weak
		- Andrea scoops up her body and heads back up to Luca
		- Luca tells Andrea to put Cecilia in her quarters and he'd leave a note with instructions for how to tend to her
- Salamah still looking for the next reference to Niccolo Giovanni
	- Found Niccolo had it! Now it's mine!
- Sorin arrives when they're all in the library
	- He asked for any letters for him to be sent to the estate
- Andrea says he should probably see if 'abd wrote a note back
	- It's on the way to the Chantry, and it would probably be fine to go as a coterie
- Salamah points out the two references she found
	- Complaining about Veronica and her love of gossip over anything of actual substance ensues

Coterie heads to the drop location
- Andrea in the lead
- Carlo just behind
- Sorin kind of in third
- Salamah in the back, hiding in the shadows

- Sorin gets tackled, there's a knee on the back of his head
- Carlo feels a blade pressed against his leg - instinct is to stop
- "You haven't betrayed me, have you, Andrea?"
- Andrea explains that we were just looking for a note
- 'abd asks why there are two Sabbat in the city
	- Salamah has a back and forth with him about not being in the Sabbat anymore
- Asks why we're going to the Tremere chantry
	- Explains about Veronica and the Book of Nod
	- He warns us about gargoyles - Sorin spits at that
	- Don't go in the front doors - go through the catacombs instead
- 'abd straight up disappears in front of us
- Made a plan, next game storm the chantry
