### Game Start

Recap
Leave 'abd's haven
Discussion about what we found
We're probably looking for a Tremere at this point - not sure if Marco is involved, but it's our best lead
Probably should look in the chantry
- Maybe the Gargoyles know something
- Sorin remembers an odd moment a couple of nights previously - pretty sure there was a door when he walked past it once, but not when he passed it again - unsure if the chantry was being weird

Head to the chantry
- Sorin is used to walking along the path in the bottleneck and avoids small piles of ashes that denote sigils
- Carlo isn't paying attention and almost steps on a sigil before Andrea grabs him and chucks him back towards the door

Carlo the cat hunts some rats

The door Sorin remembers was on the second floor
Salamah pokes at the space looking for sigils or a mechanical way to operate the door
Andrea looks for sigils and whether the wall is just an illusion
Carlo pokes at the wall looking for weak points
Andrea feels like something is just out of reach
Salamah summons Arms of Ahriman to search the wall
One tentacle touches a fire sigil and explodes in flames
Carlo runs away in fear
The tentacles don't find anything
Andrea looks at the wall with Sense Aura
Sigils light up with red/gray with black veins (the Not-feratu's aura)
- A rough arc across a section of the wall
- Concealment sigils with a couple defensive sigils
Andrea says that we found him while staring at the wall, eyes unfocused
Salamah takes a closer look - can see a couple sigils now
- Can read that there's a sigil of reinforcement
- Often on vaguely important doors
- Might suggest that breaking through the door might be hard
Sorin is curious about exactly how hard that is
The door itself - probably really difficult
The wall around it? Maybe not?

Carlo
- Winds up outside the front door
- Goes and finds a quick snack
- Tries to head back into chantry via the front door
- The ward repels him by making him think he needs to go back home
- Eventually decides to go back into the chantry via the catacombs again

Sorin wants to burrow through the walls
Salamah reconsiders - but needs Andrea's help
Salamah slaps Andrea with a tentacle
Carlo returns - "Hello, I got a snack. What's up?"
Decide a better plan is to knock?
Sorin just knocks - oh yep, that's a door
- Who dat?
- Sorin? (Housekeeping?)
Irritated Nosferatu with a Tremere voice (the Not-feratu) asks who the fuck we are and how we got past the wards
Sorin: "My name is Sorin, I work here"
Not-feratu responds with lightning bolts - hits Sorin
Everyone but Andrea gears up for war
- Andrea tries to appeal to the Marco inside the Tremere
- He doesn't even acknowledge his name
- Hits Sorin with lightning again as Sorin is changing form
- Carlo attacks him quickly and gets out of the way
- Sorin goes to dislocate the Not-feratu's arm - rips it off
	- He can give it back if Marco returns, but he doesn't want to get hit by lightning again
- Salamah grapples the Not-feratu with tentacles
- Andrea uses the Not-feratu's name and uses Song of Serenity to try and calm him down
	- Does not quite get it yet
- Sorin gets electrocuted without a gesture
- Carlo tries to Dominate him - doesn't work because he's an elder
- Sorin rends the osseous frame on the Not-feratu
- Eruption of blood in Andrea's face
	- He manages to not hunger frenzy - barely - cannot act for a turn
- Not-feratu steals vitae from Salamah
	- Andrea needs to avoid frenzy again - hunger frenzies on Marco the Not-feratu

Game End
