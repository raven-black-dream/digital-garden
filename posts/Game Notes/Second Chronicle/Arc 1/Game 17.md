### Game Start

Recap
What was Sorin doing towards the end of that night
- Work at the chantry
- Still working on the study of Thaumaturgy

Carlo lets Lorenzo know about the corpse he left
"Oh, that's you."

Andrea and Salamah continue to discuss specifics around trading disciplines/skills and training

The next evening [[11-24-1515]]

Sorin
- Goes to talk to Balc
	- Another body found on the roof like others found on the roofs
- Continues on to the estate to talk to Salamah

Salamah
- Hungry
- Finds Hugo to feed on

Carlo
- Borso is in his usual chair
	- Getting used to his new job
	- No breaking legs *sad face*
- They already found the corpse - they're "investigating"
	- Carlo should probably lay off the rooftop corpse decoration business for now

Andrea
- Lucia is standing at the end of Andrea's bed
- She has a scroll wrapped in a ribbon
	- Obviously not from Francesco
	- Large pendant seal hanging from the ribbon
	- Formal, official seneschal note
- Been officially summoned due to having caused the explosion in the Warrens
	- Investigate the disappearance of a Cainite from the Warrens
- All the official formal footnotes
- Explains to Lucia what the letter was, asks if she knows anything that could be helpful
- Marco is the Nosferatu who is missing
- Leonello would be a good place to start
- Saves the letter for the others to read
- Goes to find the others
- Finds Salamah and shows her the letter - they'll meet in the library to talk
- Then walks in on Carlo pulling on his pants to give him the same news
- Finds one of his ghouled rats and sends him to find Sorin with a message

The Library
- Andrea shares the scroll with the others
	- Tells us what he knows of Marco
	- Leonello might be a good place to start
		- Looks directly at Carlo
		- Salamah has no idea who Leonello is
			- One of Carlo's "men"
			- Oh wait, actually one of his former mercenaries
			- Salamah desperately wants to ask why Leonello is Nos and Borso is a ghoul
- Sorin walks in
	- Andrea gives extra Cliff's Notes version
	- Has anyone tried looking for Marco?
		- The Nos probably tried to solve the problem themselves first
- Do we do what we did with the Harpy's notes? See what work was done before and do better?
- Talk to the Nosferatu either way
- Andrea debates taking the whole coterie or just going himself first
- We all head to the Warrens

The Warrens
- Andrea takes us the non-Nosferatu route to the Warrens
- Twisted Nosferatu etc.
- Rats acting way too much in concert - very orderly horde of rats
- See a few Nosferatu that Andrea recognizes
- Bee line to where Leonello sleeps

When did you last see Marco?
Why?
He's missing
Leonello is giving Andrea sass - Andrea usually doesn't come down, unless delivering notes from Pietro, so why's he here?
Andrea holds up the note from Pietro

Last saw Marco three nights ago - he was heading out of the Warrens
- Said he found something really cool
- Hasn't learned that they're persona non grata up top
- Marco kept looking for that little tidbit to give to Pietro to be able to join the upstairs people
- He was looking for intel on the Scourge "the one they keep telling us exists"
	- Salamah laughs and says she was dragged off by the Scourge the other month for a chat with Marcus
- Leonello doesn't seem to believe her
- Sorin wonders why it's a concern after 3 days
	- The Nos know things, and none of them know where he is
	- The Nos are good at hiding - but not from each other
	- Not even Vincent - with all the rats in Italy - can find him
- Get some potential details from Leonello
	- Perhaps we need to talk to 'abd
- Leave Leonello and go to 'abd's message place
- Phrase the message in a vague way that will hopefully get him to talk to us
- 'abd steps out of the shadows
- Salamah hits the ground on her knees - staring at the ground
- Carlo says hello
- 'abd says hello back - with his daggers
- Grabs Carlo by the throat and asks in Arabic if Carlo stole "it"
- Salamah understands and asks what it is - in Arabic
- Something from his collection
- 'abd takes blood through Carlo's skin (but no one knows exactly what's happening)
- Salamah says Carlo we didn't take anything and starts talking to him in a calm voice
- 'abd removes his daggers from Carlo and lets Carlo fall to the ground
- Salamah begins translating between 'abd and the coterie
- 'abd collects Debitum (debt - but he says it in Arabic)
	- He's definitely capitalizing that word - so Salamah translates it that way
- When Andrea asks for clarifications - he specifies Heart's Blood
- It's been gone for 4 days
- No sign of who took it
- Andrea asks if he wants us to take a look
- 'abd walks off and looks for us to follow
- He leads us to his haven and tells us to forget it once we leave

Investigation
- Clan symbols on all the bottles
- Also names - including Giovanna
- Missing bottle is from the middle of a section of Tremere bottles
- Prayer rug is slightly off from the correct direction of Mecca
- If someone takes a bottle they could consume the blood of the unworthy (effectively diablerie)
- Could be someone with Tremere powers hidden somewhere in the city
- 'abd corrects Andrea: A Tremere elder
