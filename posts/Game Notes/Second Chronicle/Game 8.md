### GM Notes

- [ ] Salamah's shadow and eerie presence
- [ ] Response from Vincent (a few days)
- [ ] Ghouls:
	- [ ] Borso - fed vitae ???
	- [ ] Balc - fed vitae on 10-06-1515
	- [ ] Lucia, Maria, and Luca are probably always okay because Andrea is on top of things, but could also list them here

### Pre-Game

### Game Start

Recap

Andrea and Salamah wondering about where Carlo and Sorin are
Hear a loud thunderclap from upstairs
Move quickly in that direction - many more floors than we thought
Carlo has been tossed across the room, is now propped against a bookcase attempting to recover

Carlo states that the book attacked him
Andrea goes to look at the book
- leather and brass clasp, sigils, leather is cut
- Salamah goes to try to read them
	- Variant on storm
	- Warding sigil
- Carlo probably set off the sigils, but Salamah doesn't trust her reading of the sigils enough to be confident in that
- Carlo says the book went off when he cut the strap, so it's probably fine to open
	- Maybe we should take the book with us
- Salamah takes the book and the three leave, looking for Sorin

Sorin is in Zulo form
Much gargoyle fight
Sorin roars as he activates potence and dives back in
- Andrea, Salamah, and Carlo hear two very distinctive roars
- Could be Sorin, could be other danger, could be both

When Andrea, Salamah, and Carlo reach the fight
- They see a giant, hairy, gore-covered shape beating on a large gargoyle-like creature
- Don't recognize either
- Vitae everywhere
- Decide not to engage
- Salamah hangs out in the shadows to ensure whomever wins doesn't follow them up

Sorin manages to beat the gargoyle into torpor
Stakes the gargoyle with its own rib cage
Picks up the body and begins dragging it upstairs

Salamah attacks from the shadow to try and trip Sorin (doesn't know it's Sorin)
- Make noise to warn Andrea and Carlo
- Trips him with tentacles

Andrea and Carlo wonder where Salamah went
Sorin looks around with his hand eye and spots Salamah in the shadows
Salamah notices the hand eye
Oh wait I think it's Sorin
Andrea and Carlo appear cautiously
Andrea asks if it's Sorin - Sorin gives a very gorey, ichor and vitae covered thumbs up
Andrea asks what happened
Sorin sighs and leaves Zulo shape
He picked a fight, there are gargoyles
Sorin asks if we found the book, he didn't, we didn't
No useful books in this entire place
Salamah holds up the lightning book
Sorin asks if it still shoots lightning - they don't know
Throw the book to a clean spot
Sorin detaches his hand again - sets it free to skitter through the ichor and flip through the book
Nothing happens when it opens the book
It can't read it and looks confused
Sorin waves it back and declares the book safe
Salamah goes to collect the book
- feels that something is wrong
- Beast takes control and throws the book
- The book lands and lightning shoots from it into the ceiling

Maybe she touched a specific part
Sorin's hand is still detached so he sends it over to poke everything
When the hand pokes a sigil, another lightning bolt appears

Sorin says Salamah owes him a hand and wonders if we should take the book with us
Andrea thinks we should leave it or return it to the upstairs room
Salamah offers to look it over and figure out if it's worthwhile
Salamah lies through her teeth about what's in the book
Suggests leaving it back in the room
They should all go together
Sorin asks if gargoyles are considered kindred
Andrea says they're made in a different process but yes
Sorin drops the body in disgust because he lost his snack
Andrea asks whether the gargoyle will survive as it is

While they are discussing the gargoyle, Salamah secrets the book away into her shadows

They go to "return" the book, Salamah puts it amongst some other plain books
They decide to leave - go out the way they came in
It's about 12:30 or 1ish
However, Sorin, Andrea, Salamah collapse into daysleep
Carlo has a moment of 'wait, but it's only midnight' before he too collapses

Day rises on Florence [[10-07-1515]]
- Daylabourer returns to Balc's store
- Luca walking the streets of Florence, talking to people
- Maria taking care of little Andrea

Night falls, the coterie awakens
- Salamah wakes with the hunger of the Abyss screaming in her ears

Awaken in the room we had been in, but there's a distinct passage of time
- Feels like we woke up on a new evening

Decide to leave ASAP
As Carlo walks through doorways he turns around and goes back the way he came
Is it him or us?
It's probably him
Finally convince him to follow
Make it to the chokepoint
Carlo steps on one of the flame runes
Flame lights his clothes on fire
Carlo runs so fast in fear frenzy he puts the fire out but makes it into the catacombs
Andrea catches on fire after Carlo runs past him
Andrea keeps his head
Salamah keeps her head
Sorin frenzies in the other direction

Salamah uses Nocturne to help Andrea smother the flames - he stops, drops, and rolls to smother as well
They get the fire out, Salamah releases Nocturne
Want to try and get Sorin and get out

Sorin has managed to chill out - tries to make his way back towards the exit, and if he finds anything en route he will kill and eat it (not Salamah or Andrea, important caveat)
- Finds a gargoyle on the way
- Zulo form to attack
- Grapples it, drains it dry
- Slight addiction to vitae
- Memories of the gargoyle from creation to abuse from the Tremere to rebellion to death
- He is no longer hungry

Salamah and Andrea appear just as Sorin starts to get up from the rapidly decaying corpse
- They ask if Sorin is okay
- Sorin doesn't respond but heads towards the exit
- Salamah and Andrea step aside and then just follow him out

Carlo comes to from his frenzy in a very unfamiliar place
Still underground, no stairs nearby, but a few ladders to rickety sections of habitation
No humans around
Turns and goes back the way he came
Wanders around
Hears a raspy voice that's very familiar - calls from the upper level
- What the fuck are you doing here Carlo?
- It's Leonello

Back to Sorin, Andrea, and Salamah
- As Andrea turns to look at Sorin as he's walking away - sees the tail end of memories that Sorin just drank - small acts of rebellion, feel pangs of uselessness, settle on the feeling of dread
	- Sees a ghostly figure standing, talking at the foot of the stairs before the spear haft erupts from one of their chests, and the other is pinned to the ground by a shape that seems familiar

When they reach the chokepoint, Sorin reverts his form so he doesn't set off any sigils
They finally get out
Andrea finally relaxes a bit, pulls out paper and writes a 'we are out' note - leaves it in front of the shiny door
Andrea wants to head to the estate
Salamah needs to feed - feels she shouldn't do it at the estate
Sorin regrows his hand and needs to feed as well

Carlo sees Leonello
- He doesn't know where he is
- He's in [[The Warrens]]
- Explains how he got there, wants to get back to the manor
- Giving out details about how they were looking for a book
- Found a book with "some research" in it
- All this being said in the Warrens
- Gives an open invitation to Leonello to visit the estate
- Leonello gives him instructions on how to get out
- Carlo doesn't beat Andrea home

Andrea arrives at the estate
- Luca is in his office
- Looking for Lucia first, but finds Luca
- Luca is relieved - feared the worst
- Cecilia is on the mend - on light duties for awhile
- Asks if Lucia has managed to stay out of trouble
	- Luca hasn't seen her all evening
- Luca hired the two best candidates for the pantry

Carlo returns
- Andrea asks where he got to
	- The Warrens, apparently
	- Saw Leonello, he led Carrlo out
- Andrea asks what terms the two of them are on now
- They had started speaking recently
- Carlo estimates their relationship is luke warm, he invited Leonello to the estate
- Andrea is concerned that they don't really have the people to feed five
- Carlo is going to get cleaned up and find food
- Andrea reminds Carlo that Cecilia is still recovering and to leave her be

Carlo goes to change
Borso is pissed and sitting there
- Thinks Carlo was just with someone the night before, but is pissed he didn't send a note
- Carlo gestures at his clothes - does it look like I just lost track of time?
	- Carlo describes the night(s) he had
- Carlo needs food - Borso offers
- Talks about Leonello
- Feels from Borso, plans to heal, and then go out
