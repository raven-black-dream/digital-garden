Recap
Salamah's Abyss creature that is watching Brother Antonio returns
Shadow does not care who sees it - starkly visible in the hallway
As it approaches Salamah - it shifts into a spider-like thing to climb her
Then it shifts into a snake-like thing to wrap around Salamah's neck and in her shadow
- Brother Antonio is in the ossuary with several corpses on slabs, drawing a circle of protection
Salamah lets everyone know what she saw - she's going to head to Elysium to see if Brother Antonio is around and able to be disturbed. Carlo doesn't want to risk Brother Antonio's anger/disappointment/whatever for his not following instructions and Andrea is going to Zohan's 

Salamah
- Heads to the ossuary
- Several of the younger Cainites are around, as well as a few more prominent members of society - such as Carlo the Herald, Pietro is looming in a corner etc.

- Salamah attempts to redirect him subtly, but he be Gangrel
- Carlo pouts

- Brujah talks about wanting to know what the loud conversation was about
- Salamah says he'll learn about the important things one day, young one
- Brujah frenzies and attacks Salamah - TAKE THAT BACK

- Brother Antonio emerges - thanks Pietro as well
- Salamah asks for a moment of Brother Antonio's time - he grants it
- They head to his office as Pietro tells the room to clean up the Brujah and drag him back to Guidobaldo - gives a note
- Brother Antonio bites down on the racist remark to the Moor and asks how he can help
- Salamah lays out the deal with the corpse and asks for assistance in finding out who killed him
- He agrees after some back and forth - asks whose ghoul it is and Salamah tells him on the condition that the cost of the favour will not be passed on as it is Salamah asking
- They part on half-decent terms - Salamah will find out where the corpse is and when Brother Antonio can attend it
- Salamah checks out her oubliette before returning to the esate - it is as she left it.

Andrea
- Goes to visit Zohan
- He's disappointed Lucia isn't with him, clothes aren't ready yet
- Says he should come with Lucia next time and closes the door

Carlo

- Borso has been meticulously caring for his weaponry
- Talk about the ghoul corpse - including that there is someone else to look at the body
- Borso heads out for his guard shift

Coterie
- Salamah says what happened in Elysium

Next evening 12-04-1515
- Carlo and Salamah meet with Brother Antonio in the sepulchre beneath the church (Santa Maria de la Croce) - Andrea doesn't really want to see this
- Corpse is laid out - mostly stripped, just covered for modesty
- Wound is quite terrible - surprising that the ghoul managed to get all the way home
- Brother Antonio investigates the corpse
- Sticks his fingers in the wound to gauge depth
- Brother Antonio cuts his finger, bleeds a drop onto the corpse's chest
- Corpse very quickly turns to ash with just the head remaining
- Brother Antonio performs Hamlet before Hamlet was written - Alas! Poor Yorick, I knew him (i.e. holds up head and talks to it) - okay less so now that it's just a head and not the skull
- Asks what we want to know
- The events of the night he was killed
- The temperature in the room drops and Salamah feels uneasy
- The eyes of the head shine with pale blue light - small flame burning behind each pupil - looks very wrong
- Skull begins to speak out loud and describe the last day/night of his life
- He was finally set free
- On the way home he stopped a mugging - must've been stabbed
- As he walked home he felt cold, then he felt everything leave him
- No idea who stabbed him - early hours of morning - punched him so the victim could get away - thought he'd just been punched in the ribs
- No idea who was holding him - seemed to be trying to learn more about our side of the city
- Taken from the road from Lena's
- Brother Antonio is getting hangry
- Carlo goes to get Borso - who walks into this hellish scene
- What the fuck?
- Asks Borso to donate some blood
- What the fuck? Okay I guess.

- Brother Antonio will be having a lovely conversation with the harpy
- Many loving sentiments before apologizing for failing Lena
- Brother Antonio ashifies the head as it's still speaking and then wishes them all a good evening and leaves

Scene with Lena and Salamah - start of next game

Two nights later (12-06-1515) - around midnight
- Knock on the door
- Hans opens the door - well-dressed gentleman outside
- Perhaps a touch too rich for the current neighbourhood - lesser nobility - dripping in jewels, potentially breaking sumtuary laws
- Hans declaration - Yo Andrea! I think he's richer than you!
- Andrea hurries to the door as the stranger asks to be let in
- It's Lorenzo Giovanni looking for Carlo
- Andrea invites him in and goes to find Carlo
- If this is Andrea's domain - why is he looking for Carlo?
- Coterie-mates also stay at the estate
- Once he delivers what he has to deliver he'll go talk to the Prince - thanks them for the letter of introduction
- When Carlo finally notices their presence, Lorenzo hands over the book and Carlo thanks him before immediately handing it over to Andrea
- Salamah comes up behind - mesmerized and disgusted by the jewelry, then gets distracted by the book and startles Lorenzo
- Andrea takes Lorenzo to Marcus through the catacombs while Salamah gets started on the translation of Veronica's Notes

Game End
- Timeskip is to May 1st, 1517
