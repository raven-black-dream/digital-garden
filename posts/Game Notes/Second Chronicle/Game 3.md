### Game Start

Still in Veronica's haven
- Some candles around that we could use, but many burned down
- Salamah offers to do a ritual to try and see in the dark - the following evening
- There are still notes to go through
- Salamah asks about notes on the fresco
	- Andrea pulls out some notes
	- Artist unknown, Cainites trysting in a garden
	- Another investigator suspects it's a mythological reference, but is unsure of which one
	- Sort of in the style of Giotto (painter from the 1300s)
		- Not his hand, nor probably not anyone from his school
		- Someone influenced by it
		- Other than being in a slightly archaic style, can't seem to find a specific artist that is close enough in style
- Carlo asks whether Veronica had any ghouls that may have painted it
- No notes at the beginning of the folio
- Decide to leave the haven for the night, and look at the notes before trying again the following night

Andrea wants to go investigate the catacombs before going back to the estate - everyone decides to come with

Catacombs
- Do not take the most direct route back - want to approach the hall from the same direction as before
- Andrea looks for any recent activity - sees nothing
- Salamah traces the sense of the Abyss to a section of the room where the shadow is darker and doesn't seem like it's cast by anything
	- Pokes at it with Shadow Play
		- Doesn't feel like regular shadow - feels like reaching through the door into a deep freezer - pang of incredible loneliness
	- Can't sense whether it's by anyone specific, but maybe a ritual will be able to tell that
- Salamah motions everyone back down the hall
	- Explains what she knows about the Abyssal spot and that she may be able to find out more with additional study
- Andrea wants to talk to Pietro, the rest of the coterie return to the manor
- Before he goes there, Andrea leaves a note for Francesco

Pietro's Office
- Curt 'come in'
	- Andrea and Lucia enter
- Pietro is sitting with a stack of papers in the main area, not in his back office
- He's had a night - dealing with the elder Cainites and their formal grievances over the Prince's decision
- Andrea asks how many Lasombra Pietro is aware of in the city
	- Only Salamah
- Andrea says there may be another - mentions Lucia getting contacted and the Abyssal patch by the old hangout that Salamah found
- Andrea gives off an aura of 'I'm sorry to bring you this news'
- Pietro looks at Andrea with his 'I have a job for you' look
	- Pietro gives Andrea a piece of paper to Vincent to ask about what his informants have to say - probably not tonight
- As they go to leave, Pietro calls after Lucia to say perhaps next time don't follow Andrea to court
	- He was probably the only one who noticed, but Elysium is supposed to be a place devoid of discipline use; if he was still Keeper, there would've been consequences
- Andrea hurries away with Lucia

The rest of the coterie
- Salamah heads back to the estate with the folio - focusing on notes about the fresco
	- Investigators believe the answer is in her notes somewhere, but haven't been able to find it
	- At about the 20yr mark - Note that the fresco has been there awhile
		- Interviewed someone who said the fresco had been there for as long as they'd known her
- Carlo heads back to the estate to do some reading of history of the city before sleep
- Sorin also heads back and works on cross-referencing items in the notes
- Andrea leaves notes for his ghouls

During the Day
- A merchant spends the day walking, talking, and writing - Balc

Following Evening [[10-04-1515]]
- Sorin builds out his underground cubby into a room
	- Kills many people to get the juice to do it
- When Sorin is done, Balc is waiting
	- Sorin wants to put bars on the trap door
- Sorin goes out to find a desperate labourer
	- Finds a dock worker who is drinking heavily and has just been fired
	- Sorin wants to hire him to excavate a cellar

- Salamah slept at the estate
	- Completes the Pierce the Veil ritual
		- Controllable Night Sight
			- Rouse check when used
	- Too distracted and forgot to shave her head - full head of hair
	- Goes to talk to others in the estate

Carlo
- Borso is awake
- Carlo will need him to investigate something the next day
	- Fresco in Veronica's haven
- Goes to look in on his mortal family
	- He's been introduced as Cousin Carlo from out of town
	- They ask why he never eats dinner with them
		- He does have deceptive eating, but claims an alium allergy

Andrea
- Wakes up and feels a weight resting on his chest
	- Lucia's head resting on his chest - curled up next to him, not how Andrea fell asleep
- Extracts himself - Lucia doesn't wake up
- Goes to look for Luca
	- Going to hire people for the estate
	- Needs input from Sorin and Salamah
	- Andrea the Small slept poorly so Maria didn't have much time for Andrea's note
		- Absolutely NOTHING to do with the new guests
			- Absolutely NOTHING at all
- Goes out to meet with Vincent and deliver Pietro's note
	- Pietro has traded a boon from Andrea for information about whether there are other Lasombra in the city
	- Vincent will send Quinn (the rat) with a note when he has information
	- Vincent sends Andrea with the amended note (adds Andrea's name to it) to the new harpy
- Andrea goes to the new harpy - in Elysium - with the amended note before heading back to the estate
	- Bartholemew - accountant stereotype; hunched over a ledger
	- Looks stressed
	- No numbers being exchanged, but his hand is flicking over an abacus
	- Andrea startles Bartholemew	
	- Very few records for Andrea in the ledger - why doesn't he want to participate in the economy of the city?

Salamah
- Knows her new night sight is permanent and controllable
- Moves towards the library, but is fairly distracted

Coterie arrives back at the estate
- Salamah has long hair now - when Carlo tugs on an end and alerts her she cuts off most of it and it turns to ash
- Salamah is a little fanatical regarding the ritual and going to see the haven
- The coterie heads to the haven

Veronica's Haven
- Same guards as the previous night
- Salamah goes into the room with darksight and examines the fresco
	- Memorizes it so she can match it to other artists
	- Doesn't know much about it, but it is a true fresco and not one painted on dry plaster
- Andrea goes looking around some more
	- Finds Veronica's book of hours, closed, in the main room
	- Was once open, but is now closed (has been closed for awhile)
	- Opens it, there's a quote on the first page (see Google Drive)
	- Opens it further to the page with the ribbon
		- Note to meet with Giovanna
- Carlo was looking around, but got bored and went to talk to the guards outside
- Sorin went looking as well, mostly focusing on the Grecian and Roman art
	- Neoclassical work
	- All draws on mythology
	- Many pieces which were done by people who were nobodies in Veronica's time, but are now famous
		- da Vinci - stuff from his teen years
		- Botticelli - early sketches
	- Browses Veronica's library
		- Glances in the sketchbooks
		- Flips through and eyes settle on a sketch that looks familiar - sketch of the fresco
			- Title: Lilith and Caine in the Garden of Twilight
