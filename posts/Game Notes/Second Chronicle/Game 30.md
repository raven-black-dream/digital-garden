Recap

Andrea sends out hounds looking for the hunters' scents
Andrea shows Dust, Corus, and Cerberus the broken spear haft and arrow and asks them to find those who had them last; also gives location of attack
Cerberus looks at the other two like "not my thing, you two do it"
Corus sniffs all over and tried to inhale the fletching
sniffs into the door \<thud\> then Andrea opens the door
Carlo asks if the dog will be fine since walking into a door sniffing
Andrea says Dust will keep Corus out of too much trouble
(Corus: 5 successes, Dust: 4 Successes)

Carlo wants to talk to to guards about looking for the hunters
find Borso asleep snuggling his sword
tries to close the door quietly
Carlo writes a note for Borso

"Can you leave this on Borso's face?"
"...do you not have a message drop place with Borso?"
"Yeah, on each others' faces"
...
more sassy conversation, Andrea takes the note and adds "Carlo insists your message drop is on your face. You really ought to consider getting a message tray from Luca - Andrea"
stealth+dex: 5 successes
Andrea gingerly tucks the note gingerly into the quillions by Borso's face
then tries to leave again quietly

Andrea checks the office to see if there is progress on the financial investigation
the conspiracy map has grown, things are put away neatly
a note "Lorenzo Giovanni?" was added, a few businesses singled out on the map

go ask Vincent what "object" they are looking for?
Both realize that Carthage was destroyed a long time ago (146BCE)
(Carthage was ruled by Brujah)

Carlo: (Brujah perspective) Carthage was a utopia where humans and cainites lived peacefully and cooperatively, remembered as the third city, ruled by Troile, Ventrue and Malkavians in Rome came after Carthage and wars happened and Carthage was sacked

Andrea: (sources outside of the Brujah) While it was at the start a utopia, it was the third city, it is believed by many cainite scholars that Troile became influenced by a Baali and before the fall of Carthage the idea of cainites and mortals living in harmony it was more like there was a death cult with blood sacrifices etc - Ventrue and Malkavians wanted to stop the terrible things happening there

head towards warrens
chatting travel plans for some of the walk
make it to warrens - see Jac catch that they are there and starts to head in their direction, but sees that she's been seen and stomps off

Is she upset with me?
You remember what happened last time?
she fed on me and then ...changed?
she dropped her illusion, yeah
aaaah that makes sense....why would she be upset at me though?
Andrea just sighs - shall we head directly to Vincent?

the warrens are slightly different from even a few nights ago, make it to Vincent's door
as they approach the door it swings open and a rat the size of a medium dog will trot out
Andrea and the rat sort of nod at each other as they pass
Carlo gets out of the way of the rat

Vincent calls "oh come in already"
Bronze age spear but in fantastic condition
are you expecting it to be in the ruins of Carthage?
oh probably
conversation about Vincent not being particularly forthcoming about information without something in exchange - could just point them in the direction and let them figure it out
He'll exchange 3 questions for 3 questions

Carlo - Are there any precautions we have to take to retrieve the spear?
"I will take it to mean you are asking me if I know the precautions required and not are there any because obviously there are - the only precautions I know about are the precautions in handling any sharp object, it is likely incredibly sharp"
fairly innocous question, so will ask similar in return: what do you know of the fall of the Tremere in the city? "I wasn't even in town for it... their gargoyles revolted and did something to them?"
Carlo being Carlo and not making connections to 'abd
Andrea does not keep a straight face
Vincent pokes Andrea for more info
'abd has a blood hunt on him from Tremere and would have been helping the gargoyle's actions along in his own way

Andrea - Who has the spear if someone has it, if not where is it located more specifically than the region of Carthage
last recorded in the ruins of the palace of Carthage
that sounds like a long time ago
around the fall of Carthage
if that's where it was a thousand years ago, it could be anywhere now
my sources are good, doubts that an object such as this would go on too much of a walkabout
not so much who currently has it as who once had it "if it was in the world we would know"
"Your coterie used to be four, now it is three - what can you tell me about what happened?"
Andrea gives a small laugh That actually ties into Carlo's answer; Sorin tried to break into 'abd's haven and as is obvious is no longer functional

==Salamah will get 1 question - TBD==

WE WANT THE SCENE OF BORSO WAKING UP TO THE NOTE :P

fast forward to Borso waking up with two notes next to his face -
dawn breaks
Borso wakes yawning, loosening his grip on his sword, hear paper rustle then fall and tap the end of his nose; blinks several times, opens the first of the pieces of paper
looks at it still yawning, blink a few more times, how am I supposed to arrange travel to Carthage? didn't Carthage...? guess that's clarification for the boss later... what's this postscript...? second note... mumblemumble message tray
looks over to where Carlo is usually laid out
"really boss, on my face, huh? you know I only leave you notes on your face cause you'll miss them otherwise" snorts
gets up gets dressed, greets Luca and asks for message tray
maybe have to leave a note on Carlo's face to remind him to check the message tray



To do's
object in Carthage - plan travel
"object" Vincent
friending at the warrens
talk to Francesco
financial investigation
