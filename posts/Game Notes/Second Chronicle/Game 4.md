### Game Start
- Recap

Pick up with Sorin in the library, with the sketchbook
- Heads to Salamah in the bedroom to discuss the fresco
- Salamah is balanced on a chair, on a table, in the middle of the room looking closely at the fresco
- Sorin says he found the title of the fresco, hands the book over to Salamah
	- Salamah's shadow almost grabs the book instead, but Salamah gets to it first
	- Salamah holds the book so maybe her shadow can read over her shoulder
- Salamah recognizes the sketch as a first draft of the fresco
	- Caine - father of all vampires
	- Knows small part of the myth - after being expelled from the garden of Eden, Caine met and was taught the original disciplines at that point - Celerity, Potence, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Animalism, Auspex, Protean, Presence, and Dominate
	- When looking at the fresco - found very very fine ridges throughout the fresco
- Sorin comments that he thought "her name was Veronica, not Lilith"
	- Salamah tries to explain Lilith, but doesn't have a solid memory of the myth
	- However, the fresco screams Toreador - putting herself IN mythology
- Decide to go looking for the others to show them and get their insight

Andrea
- Looking through Veronica's Book of Hours
- Through the last few years of her life - had several meetings with Nico
	- Nico was not one of the past investigators

Carlo
- Stepped out to talk to the guards
	- Talking about the guard schedule
	- Who has been in and out of the place
		- These two have been on that post for most of the last year
		- Haven is pretty locked down, no comings and goings
	- How are the Brujah
		- Fine
		- Population of Brujah has been declining over the last 20 years or so
			- Marcus' decrees about violence in the city
			- Marcus being a tyrant
			- Brujah want out
			- Small numbers trickle out consistently
		- Alessandra - very typically Brujah in her temper
			- Gone on to find new reasons to be furious at Carlo's existence
			- Talk about how she's mad that she made Carlo because she got flak for it
			- Questioning whether Carlo is a Brujah

Salamah and Sorin join Andrea in the main area
- Salamah's eyes are pools of inky shadow
- Tell Andrea the title: Lilith and Caine in the Garden of Twilight
	- Also mention the ridges in the fresco
	- Andrea doesn't know, but since Nico was mentioned in the book of hours, the next stop will be the library
- Return items back to where they found them
- Find Carlo outside chatting with the guards
