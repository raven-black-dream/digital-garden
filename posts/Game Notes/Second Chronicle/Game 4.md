### Game Start
- Recap

Pick up with Sorin in the library, with the sketchbook
- Heads to Salamah in the bedroom to discuss the fresco
- Salamah is balanced on a chair, on a table, in the middle of the room looking closely at the fresco
- Sorin says he found the title of the fresco, hands the book over to Salamah
	- Salamah's shadow almost grabs the book instead, but Salamah gets to it first
	- Salamah holds the book so maybe her shadow can read over her shoulder
- Salamah recognizes the sketch as a first draft of the fresco
	- Caine - father of all vampires
	- Knows small part of the myth - after being expelled from the garden of Eden, Caine met and was taught the original disciplines at that point - Celerity, Potence, Fortitude, Obfuscate, Animalism, Auspex, Protean, Presence, and Dominate
	- When looking at the fresco - found very very fine ridges throughout the fresco
- Sorin comments that he thought "her name was Veronica, not Lilith"
	- Salamah tries to explain Lilith, but doesn't have a solid memory of the myth
	- However, the fresco screams Toreador - putting herself IN mythology
- Decide to go looking for the others to show them and get their insight

- Carlo uses Celerity to carry all the books over to the others (which is just Sorin at this point)

Salamah is looking through Cainite Lore and Occult books
