### Carlo
- Check on family
- Note from sheriff? Never received after last time skip
	- Would like to talk with Giotto regardless
	- Would like to do more with this part of the city politics
- City guard ghoul - Lorenzo
	- Get him promoted
	- What sorts of things are you going to do to accomplish that?
		- Stronger and smarter
		- Solve a major crime
			- Carlo is willing to commit a major crime and frame someone else in order for Lorenzo to have a crime to solve
			- Major theft? - see note in vampire-the-masquerade chat
				- Something that belongs to someone very important in the city
					- Theft from the goldsmith's guild
					- Maybe frame one of Giovanna's descendents? (Merchant quarter)
				- Receive commendation etc, maybe small promotion
				- Rinse/Repeat
			- May also work on getting Lorenzo married well to boost his status
- Get Borso into the city guard
- Teaching ghouls extra disciplines and/or skills
- Wants to learn Dominate - needs to find someone to teach him - asks Nico?
	- Carlo goes to the library to "Learn Dominate from a book"
		- Obviously not a thing, but then asks Nico
	- Also spent 30ish years out of Florence, maybe someone comes to visit?

### Sorin
- Scene with Andrea (to be in game)
- Lets the boon with Salamah sit?
	- Wants to go down the exploding body trap stuff
	- May lean on the boon to get help figuring out a direction for that
	- May lead to blood sorcery lol
- Salamah warns him to not approach Andrea until he has a chance to cool down some
	- Planning on staying away from the estate until we all meet up anyway
- Research and explosions
- Balc
	- Checking in - any news from the old world (Bucharest)
	- If he catches wind that he had a part in the coterie finding his lab, there may be a thing
- Sorin not interested in directly talking to NPCs
	- Maybe Balc? - Thinking
- Looking into Koldunic Sorcery and maybe Thaumaturgy
