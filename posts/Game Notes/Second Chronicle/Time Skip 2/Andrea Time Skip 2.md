City
1 - In the first night of the timeskip, he'd visit Carlo's city guard.
"How many of the last few weeks' victims were you able to identify?"
"Did you interview their relations to get background or anything? Will someone check on them / have they already?"
2 - Depending on answers to 1, and if there are people he thinks should be checked in on more: "Borso, would you go with Lucia to check on the murdered's relations? I feel like she could use some backup and it makes the most sense to go during the day when I can't be there. And I know you're Carlo's ghoul, so before you wonder why you should care, let me present it to you this way. Desperate people with nothing to lose will do desperate things. Their relations were supernaturally murdered and we don't want those desperate things to be hunting for answers. Think of it like preemptively protecting Carlo from people looking for answers or bringing the inquisition back."

Francesco
1 - What's Francesco up to? Does Andrea hear back after the letter he left in the last time skip?

Guidobaldo
1 - What protections were put in place against the Lasombra?
2 - What does Guidobaldo want in return for the info? (Lucia said he considered her help a personal favour from Andrea, does he count this against that?)
3 - Any other details that Andrea can get from Guidobaldo?

Hans/Hugo
1 - I want more interactions with Hans in ways that tell me how he reacts to the supernatural world he's now in. To that end I have contrived at least one plausible scenario for such an interaction. XD 
Andrea, after they've settled in a while, and now with the inquisition top of mind again, would introduce them to the manor, to the escape route there, and to the catacombs. "I would recommend you don't come down here unless necessary, and ideally not by yourself. But if it's humans that you're trying to escape from, there are some pretty good emergency routes through here. I'll show you the couple you should know just in case."

Luca
1 - How's Luca doing after his vacation?
2 - If he has time, there should be more medical studies with Andrea.
3 - Andrea's going to ask (a while after the vacation) about looking for replacements for some of the semi-retired staff. Franco (64) and Alfonso (65) are probably next to retire. Perhaps a different demographic than foreign mercenaries this time though Luca. I don't want the entire staff to be Hans and Hugo-like, they should probably be balanced out a bit.
4 - Andrea would have been the one driving the rebuild of the manor, but leaning on Luca heavily for logistics. He might ask Luca's opinion on fortifying / securing the estate better with the inquisition top of mind. (Fireproofing? Emergency exits?)
5 - How are the general finances doing? It having been 40 years since inheriting from Ernst, and getting whatever they could salvage from Giovanna's sire's estate, how are the businesses doing now? (Either in terms of resources as the book puts it, or additional staff / herd that he'd be able to hire and maintain for the coterie, or in terms of other general things he could do with the resources.) 

Luca/Maria/Little Andrea
1 - Perhaps at some point during the timeskip he'd go to Luca's place and say hi to everyone - it's been a while now since little Andrea used to be roaming around the estate/manor. Maybe at the month-change as part of usual reghouling interactions with Luca/Maria.

Lucia
1 - Now that the shade's done and the inquisition's dealt with for now, and having recently been sort of blindsided by her learning Awe, and Luca's warnings that something seems off with her recently, Andrea's probably trying to keep a bit more of an eye on what she's up to and spend a bit more time with her.
2 - "<to Lucia when he wakes up the next morning that she's there> So, why _did_ you choose Awe to learn, and why ask Guidobaldo?" "Well, if you're going that route, you really should get a bit better at acting. We should practice that." Possibly working on acting together. Probably away in the manor cellar.
3 - Poking a bit more at who she owes things to / who owes her now that he knows she's doing that. Asking in more indirect ways and worked into other conversations as opposed to "give me a complete accounting now".

Nico
1 - We never played out Andrea asking Nico about where he got the Tremere books... What does he say about them if Andrea asks in the timeskip?

Nosferatu
1 - Go check on the caved tunnel area, perhaps go say hi to some Nosferatu contacts and see how they're doing (incl Leonello?).  

Sorin
1 - He will be reporting everything he's learned about Sorin to Pietro, ideally when Pietro is in a reasonable / good mood, and seeing what Pietro's responses are.
2 - Are there any ways he can leverage the remainder of Sorin's blood bond to him? The way we played out the argument, Sorin did not display much respect/loyalty etc towards Andrea - Andrea did not hold really any sway with him.
3 - This is where I need storyteller input, because I am having my character acting against another player character directly. Andrea would NOT just 'live and let live' in Sorin's direction. He doesn't want Sorin continuing what he's doing. What you missed Andrea threatening Sorin with when Sorin was like "and why should I care / help with the inquisition" was expulsion from the city. Obviously that's not a thing he can actually do. There's trying to manipulate Sorin a la something like tricking him into a deeper blood bond which isn't actually doable. There's attempting to exile him from the coterie if not the city, which isn't actually doable. Bunch of things that _Andrea_ might try to do, that are not doable to another player character because story and player...
