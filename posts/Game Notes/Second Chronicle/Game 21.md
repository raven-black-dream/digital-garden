Recap

Andrea and Salamah Training Montage
- 2nd night of the short time skip
- Andrea decompressing with Quin in the library
- Salamah returns - Lena wasn't being a Super Bitch, just an Average Bitch
- Andrea asks if Salamah wants to try talking to Quin
- Salamah goes, holds out a hand and says hello
- Quin: Skepticism INTENSIFIES
- With Andrea's encouragement - Quin steps into Salamah's hand and starts squeaking at her
- Salamah's shadow runs to the other side of the room
- Quin is saying hello and asking why her shadow is so fucking creepy
- Salamah tries to sqeak back
	- TAXES
	- HERESY
	- PROBLEMATIC NOMENCLATURE
	- SALTED TROUT!
- Andrea steps in and attempts to help her say hello
- Salamah is NOT good at this
- Quin is very frustrated by all of this
- Eventually Salamah gives up and they switch to Salamah teaching Andrea stealth
- Head out to a slummy part of town - densely packed, not the merchant quarter
- Salamah gets Andrea to stealth down an alley to see how he interacts with the shadows
- Salamah proceeds to give an academic lecture on shadows and their personalities and how to interpret and therefore use various types of shadows
- Andrea continues to look skeptical
- After a few runs, Andrea starts getting better - they decide to head back to the estate so they stop looking suspicious
- Salamah gives essentially a ghost/shadow tour of the city as they walk back

Andrea and Zohan
- Zohan continues to be insulting
- Offers a few mortals who seem to be intoxicated and lounging around
	- The night will be a hazy memory for the mortals
- Zohan is trying to tempt Andrea with the mortals
- Manages to guilt and outmaneuver Andrea into partaking

Carlo and Brother Antonio
- Carlo trying to hide the fact that he didn't do the meditations
- Brother Antonio gives Carlo a 'gift' (unpleasant side effects of being mortal)
- Sends Carlo off to enjoy his evening
	- He goes for a lovely meal and drink, but can't get drunk

Salamah and Sorin are researching
- Andrea returns - drunk on opium-soaked vitae - flops on the couch
- Salamah is concerned
- Carlo returns and cannot see very well so bumps into things
	- Tells everyone about the curse
	- Salamah flicks him with potence just to see - it hurts him way more than normal
- Suddenly nature calls for Carlo - he rushes for the chamberpot in his room
- Salamah goes looking for a member of staff to help Andrea
- Finds Lucia - expresses concern for Andrea's ability to get to a safe space to sleep
- Lucia flirtatiously answers
- Salamah is unimpressed and attempts to intimidate her
- Lucia is unphased - she goes and collects Andrea, gives off possessive vibes
- Salamah continues to be unimpressed and returns to her room to research

Day breaks - activity in the city:
man sprinting stumble as he turns down an alleyway to see a random act of violence taking place, one threatening another for his purse
he bowls into the one with a knife causing enough distraction for the other to get away
hurried stumble as he exits the alleyway begging his apologies
heading home not noticing the trail of blood he leaves, not noticing until the world goes dark

- Andrea wakes to Lucia in his room - she presses for info about the previous evening
- Andrea explains the transfer of intoxicants through feeding that apparently happens
- Lucia has a note to deliver to a ghoul - she doesn't know who said ghoul is attached to

Borso like 'what the hell' about Carlo barging in to use the chamberpot

Salamah at Lena's: tonight I have two tasks for you
1 - collect a note for me, the ghoul that I would normally send to do this is missing
2 - I need information on Brother Antonio

Filian and Sorin talk visions and his sire
