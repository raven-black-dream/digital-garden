Recap
Continuing the fight
- Andrea - in hunger frenzy
- Carlo is up first - doesn't notice Andrea in hunger frenzy, attacks the Not-feratu
- Sorin also doesn't notice Andrea, but sees the blood cross his field of view - opts to deal damage through torpor
- Salamah - does see Andrea, drops her Obtenebration and begins to move away
- Not-feratu begins to swear
	- Seems he can't do this the fast way
	- Theft of Vitae's all of us
	- Brings all of us below what should be possible Hunger-wise
	- All go into torpor
Quinn-o-vision
- Swept up into Andrea's pocket when Carlo was hunting for rats
- Trapped under Andrea when we all went into torpor
- Bodies get dragged into the catacombs
- Quinn gets help
- The coterie is carried off somewhere

The coterie wakes up
- Bleary eyes but full consciousness - ancient vitae
- Very average man sitting before us
	- Dressed funny - knee length tunic, mostly white
	- Draped across chair - many yards of fabric that would've once been a toga
	- Looks like the edge of the fabric has been dipped in blood and dried
	- Quinn is on his shoulder
- Asks what we've gotten ourselves into
- Andrea responds that we found Marco
- Salamah asks what happened
	- Quinn told him that we had gotten into a pitched physical battle with not-Marco
	- We went into torpor
	- Quinn and Vincent have a short argument that we can only hear Vincent's side of
	- Vincent has saved our lives - there are responsibilities that go with that
- Sorin has a horizontal deep penetrating wound in his forehead
- Vincent gestures at Sorin - Not-Marco is apparently some older Tremere
	- The spell he used had fallen out of fashion
- Salamah notices the hole in Sorin's forehead and points it out
	- Carlo's knife was pinning a note to the Prince to Sorin's forehead
	- Carlo gets his knife back
- We are told that we are to answer Vincent's summons when he calls
- Go feed

Feeding
- Salamah feeds on someone she caught in her Oubliette - it was a young Nosferatu
	- She's probably leaving him in the Oubliette
- Sorin murders a man named Franco
	- Stages it like the 'rooftop serial killer'
- Carlo manages to not frenzy
- Andrea heads to the cattle farm and feeds on multiple oblivious cows

Everyone heads back to the estate
- Salamah and Carlo head to the library
- Andrea - looks for Lucia
	- She's not around, there's a note that she's off on business ("friend from a few months ago")
- Andrea joins Salamah and Carlo in the library
	- Ringing silence
- Some talk about telling Pietro their side of the story first
- Sorin arrives
- We prep to leave when an owl taps at the window - Andrea is the only one who notices
- Owl has a note - coterie is to meet with the Prince immediately
- Filled with Dread - coterie leaves and heads to the Council Chambers as fast and directly as they can

Council Chambers
- Pietro is outside with the weapon he used to carry as Keeper of Elysium
- Marcus is sitting in his council seat
	- Points at the note that is set up near us, open and able to be read
- Coterie goes to read it
	- Letter from the Tremere describing what had happened to the Tremere, accusing Marcus of letting an abomination into his chantry, and yet he showed mercy to us - expect word from Vienna (Tremere main chantry)
- Marcus asks for commentary
- Andrea gives a brief - we found Marco and things went sideways
- The others are staying silent to not make it worse
- Marcus states that we're in need of some re-education
	- Check in with overseers nightly until told otherwise
- Marcus says we're all on thin ice
	- Salamah especially - if she messes up again she'll be staked and left for the sun
- He tells us all to leave - so we do

On the way back to the estate
- Andrea - that went better than I thought it would
- Sorin - Don't like being punished for the Nosferatu's failure
- Andrea - bites his tongue about that
- Salamah - even if it started with the Nosferatu, our actions reflect on us
	- Will be retreating to quiet contemplation until given further instruction
	- Heads to her room
	- Studies, but finds it hard to focus
- Andrea - looking for ghouls - finds Kerberos

Owl returns sometime later - kicks the window open
- Sorin and Carlo are in the library when it returns
- Owl turns into Carlo the Herald
- Hands letters to both Sorin and Carlo
- Asks where the others are
- Carlo says - in their rooms, probably, but says nothing further
- Carlo the Herald has no idea where the fuck their rooms are
- Coterie Carlo gives directions
- Herald Carlo finds Andrea's door - knocks irritatedly
- Andrea opens the door - Herald Carlo shoves a couple of scrolls into his hands and asks where the other one is
- Andrea gives prompt instructions
- Herald Carlo knocks sharply at Salamah's door and as she opens it, he shoves the door open, shoves the scroll into her hand and turns back into an owl and flies through the window
- Salamah opens the scroll
	- Clan Ventrue Seal
	- Note from Ventrue Primogen
		- Instructions to meet the following evening
	- Salamah sits on the floor and stares at the scroll in shock
- Andrea
	- One scroll is from Pietro
		- Tried his best to assist Andrea
		- Hopes Andrea's re-education is less troublesome for him than the rest of the coterie
	- One is from Clan Toreador
		- Saddled with the burden of explaining life to Andrea
		- Gives an address for the next evening, but no time
- Carlo
	- Cappadocian seal
	- Pleasure to reintroduce him to the silent contemplation necessary in the city to not cause trouble
	- Signs off with 'Your Brother in Christ'

	- Clan Malkavian seal
	- Same rough message as the others

Following evening
- Salamah wakes up and hurries to her meeting with her overseer
- Opulent house - young boy opens the door when Salamah knocks (Philipe)
- Lena uses Majesty on Salamah - cultivating respect
- Salamah's shadow is not happy with Lena
- Asks Salamah to talk about herself
	- Surface things
- Asks why she shouldn't just go to Marcus and say Salamah is irredeemable
	- Salamah acknowledges that it is within Lena's right, but she has information and abilities that they would find useful, and she refuses to beg for her life
- Lena - "At least you have a spine"
