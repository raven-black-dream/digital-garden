Salamah

-   Abyssal spy on Pietro – eventually leaves it be
	-   Become a part of Pietro’s network of spies
	-   Come up with some shit that she's found out for Pietro over the last year+ - what has she seen, what has frustrated her because she wasn't able to see them (things that Pietro asked that she couldn't do)
		-   The Gargoyles
			-   Maybe has discovered some of their plans - if they have any.
		-   Carlo and his ghouls - political moves
		- Guidobaldo
			-   Has never figured out the whole Guidobaldo/Lena connection (double check the notes to make sure I’m not forgetting Salamah actually learning this…)
		-   The Toreador
			-   One of her spies showed her the entirety of a Toreador orgy
		-   Clergy discussing the Inquisition
		-   Watching Lorenzo Giovanni - seeing him make deals within the city and gain a small amount of prestige in the mortal realm
		-   Would Pietro care about keeping an eye on Giovanna’s old family? Like, just in case? Maybe Salamah’s spies witness one of them venturing close to the Cainite world (a Cainite is showing interest either as a childe or a ghoul, or they’re close to stumbling upon something, etc.)
		-   The Warrens
			-   Witnesses a deal for info that isn’t immediately turned into Pietro (one of his spies is involved)
			-   Some concern is expressed for the missing Nosferatu (the one from the oubliette)
		-   Watch Elysium on nights Pietro can’t
			-   Don’t interfere, just report - esp. if Brother Antonio is otherwise engaged

-   Boons for Brother Antonio
	-   Collect skeletons - all sorts, preferably human
	-   Provide some mortal dealings - i.e. something he is unable to deal with himself
	-   Find a particular book for him (something reasonable, just he can’t be bothered to go get it himself)
	-   Conduct some research
	-   Organize a private meeting between him and Lena
	-   Send a message to another city (once she has her bird ghouls)

-   Inform Lena about the ghoul’s last remarks
	-   Lena had offered a boon to the coterie - paid by acquiescing to the coterie taking some of her domain for their own
	-   Does Lena look into who originally took her ghoul – does Salamah offer? - inadvertent dominate use, Salamah is tasked with it
	
-   Getting into politics – maybe not yet, but at some point maybe she becomes the primogen of misfits

-   Oubliette
	-  Spending nights meditating in there
	-  Buy to 3 dots (6 XP)
	-  Now 5 rooms large 
	-  At some point if it catches someone, she wants to watch them deteriorate, y’know, for science.
	- What to do with Nosferatu in oubliette - Maw of Ahriman

-   Ghouls – Ravens and crows, maybe some street kids or other gang members in Florence. Inconsequential ones.
-   Buy Politics 1 = 3 XP
-   Buy Leadership 1 = 3 XP
-   Buy Alertness 2 = 4 XP
-   With downtime XP – Etiquette 1? (3)  Politics 2? (4) Perception 3? (12)

Questions
- Who gets Veronica’s haven now that we’re done with it - probably back to the Toreador
- Are there any main Cainites about to go into torpor? Filin? Guidobaldo?
