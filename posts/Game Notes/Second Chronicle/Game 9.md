### GM Notes
- [ ] Andrea has auspex, no real auspex rolls except very specific things; rely on innate abilities with auspex. Threat of overstimulation
	- [ ] Drinking the carafe of blood leads to hallucinations and the beast wanting vitae instead of human blood
- [ ] Salamah's shadow and eerie presence
- [x] Response from Vincent (a few days)
- [ ] Ghouls:
	- [ ] Borso - fed vitae ???
	- [ ] Balc - fed vitae on 10-06-1515
	- [ ] Lucia, Maria, and Luca are probably always okay because Andrea is on top of things, but could also list them here

### Pre-Game
- [ ] Questions, comments, etc
- [ ] XP

### Plot
- [ ] Player Agency
	- [ ] Feeding etc.
- [ ] Figure out where the Tremere library went

### Game Start

Salamah goes out hunting
- Dark alley - find a drunk wandering down, surprisingly alert
- He yells out and swings at her
- She grabs him, bares his neck, begins to drain him dry as she wraps them both in abyssal shadow
	- End of life - Bruno, steelworker
- Releases the abyss from her veins
- There was someone (haven't decided who yet) watching with 7 successes.

Andrea
- Looking for Lucia
- Goes to Ernst's chapel
- Is having trouble finding anything/anyone
- Goes to talk to Pietro - using common paths as a way to continue looking for Lucia
- Knocks at Pietro's door
	- Carlo accidentally set Andrea on fire
	- Andrea doesn't know what to do with the other two
	- Couldn't find what they were looking for
		- Pietro clarifies what they were looking for
		- Asks whether they talked to Brother Antonio
	- Andrea says Sorin seems awfully happy to fight gargoyles
	- Pietro says that makes sense - asks if Andrea knows what gargoyles were created for
		- Gargoyles were created to help the Tremere fight the Tzimisce
	- Pietro asks about Salamah
		- Readily uses shadows for things
		- Less likely to pick fights
		- Was the source of info for part of what happened at the chantry - Ercole and the shade
	- Pietro was writing a letter to Andrea about the hungry shade
		- Whether it was caused by Salamah or not, deal with it
	- Andrea asks about anything else going on in the city he should know about
		- Not that Pietro is aware of
	- Andrea asks whether the gargoyles have left the chantry since the revolt
		- Pietro says most of them did, he wasn't even aware there were still gargoyles in the city
		- Andrea asks if the gargoyles would be welcome in the city (OOC: Welcome is probably a strong word)
		- They wouldn't be unwelcome
	- Andrea asks if Pietro has ever successfully spoken to a ghost
		- Pietro is concerned that Andrea is losing it
	- Andrea lets Pietro know that Salamah has been "reinformed" of the rules of the masquerade 
		- Explains what happened
		- Pietro doesn't believe that they need to bring this in front of the Prince - don't let it happen again
	- Pietro wonders why Lucia isn't with Andrea
		- Hasn't seen her since getting out of the chantry
		- Pietro makes some comments about how if Lucia wasn't with Andrea, then usually she'd be handling something for him, but if he hasn't seen her, then it's interesting
- Andrea leaves the office, heading to some common areas still looking for Lucia, but also heading back toward the estate
- As Andrea approaches the library he's struck with a vision
	- Human shape obscured by something
	- Surrounded by a nimbus of colours
		- Light blue
		- Little vermillion
		- White
		- Blue and green streaks
		- Pale blotches throughout the aura
	- Crouched, moving through the catacombs, moves into the library
		- Superimposed over Andrea's vision the doors open and close
	- Time passes
	- Figure moves back out of the library and heads back towards Pietro's office
- As Andrea comes back to himself, the library doors are open and Maria is standing there
	- Had Lucia been there earlier?
	- Maria says she isn't aware of it if Lucia was
- Maria is concerned about Luca
	- He seems to be a little clingier than normal
	- A change in his behaviour - nothing obvious seems to be causing it
- Maria has a box of books to catalogue - Andrea overhears her muttering about a box of Tremere books
- Andrea stops and follows her

Carlo
- Healing injuries
- Goes looking for a meal
	- Dark alley
	- Not built for sneaking
	- Guy he's trying to sneak up on pulls a knife and tells Carlo to back the fuck off
	- Carlo rushes the guy and pins him against a wall to feed from him
	- He isn't trying to stop - drinks Dominico dry
		- Merchant
	- Carlo jumps to a roof with the body, leaves it there with the guy's knife in his own chest
- Heads back to the manor, doesn't want to be seen
	- Might affect his reputation

Salamah
- Going to work on her oubliette - choose a location
	- Far away from the abyssal doorway
	- Looking for signs of the hunger shade as she goes
	- Finds something off to the east - one of the cooridors that woud lead to the library, but far to the east
	- Untravelled section
	- Begins laying groundwork for an oubliette
- Several hours later she returns to the estate

	- Shadows
	- Can't find anything in the estate library

- The Umbriferous Man

Andrea
- Goes to talk to Luca (asleep on his face in the books)

- Wants to investigate the merchant quarters, but doesn't want to do it without the others
- Looks for his animal ghouls
	- They aren't around
- Leaves a note for Sorin and Salamah before going off looking for Lucia
	- The trace he finds is too faint to follow
	- Focuses closer and figures out a way to go
	- The trail winds hither and yon
	- Eventually gets to the library - trail runs cold

Salamah returns to the estate
- Finds the note Andrea wrote pinned to the door
- Goes to retrieve her own notes to try and figure out a way of dealing with a hungry shade
	- Brutal in the way they attack
	- Not much in the way of defense
	- Dangerous, embodiments of abyssal hunger, but not much of a threat to Salamah
		- Can be banished
		- Getting them to fight fair is difficult

Andrea
- Outside the library
- Trying to pick up the trail again - spends some significant time trying to do so

Carlo
- Struggling to find information
- Takes what notes he has and heads back to the estate
- Finds Andrea outside the library looking intently for things
	- He's very frustrated and looking for Lucia
- Carlo got some notes, but not a lot

Andrea and Carlo agree to head back to the estate
- When they arrive, the note is still pinned to the door
- Andrea sighs, takes the note down, and they enter the chantry
- Salamah can hear them talking and calls out to them
	- They discuss the hungry shade

Quin suddenly runs up Andrea's leg - with a scroll case tied to his back
Note from Vincent
- Network states the only Lasombra in the city is Salamah
- But there is a Francesco Sforza that regularly comes and goes from the city
	- Sire is sometimes aware of these trips, but not always
	- Abyssal servant(s) coming and going
- Writing is archaic, but readable

Salamah notices movement out of the corner of her eye
- When she turns her attention to it, it goes away
Andrea
- Suddenly smells Lucia, hears her quiet footsteps, his neck hairs stand on end
- Tells her that he's glad she's back
Lucia starts talking and therefore appears in the room
- Andrea and Lucia banter
- Carlo and Salamah are not involving themselves
- Lucia gives an account of her whereabouts
- Andrea accepts her account and she leaves
