### Game Start

Recap

Sorin
- After feeding, goes back to the Chantry and gives the Szlachta a once-over
	- Has sustained damage
	- Is sure the explosion was Salamah fucking up the ritual
	- Works to repair the Szlachta
- The following evening ([[10-23-1515]]) goes to check on Balc
	- He looks a little freaked out - Sorin hasn't been around for a bit, not even after the city shook
	- Labourer has made a lot of progress with the storage room, maybe another day of work
	- Should keep the labourer around just in case, so Sorin asks Balc to find him some work
	- Is there any news of home?
		- Nothing yet, expecting a shipment in a few days
		- Feeds Balc (directly)
- Goes to spend more time at the Chantry
	- No one made plans to meet
	- Szlachta work
	- Experimentation

Rest of the Coterie
- Salamah is struck dumb by her error
- Andrea attempts to step in and smooth it over
- Brother Antonio makes some good points about why we probably should've asked someone else
- Giovanni is a Venetian family
- Salamah apologizes and the coterie leaves

What to do about the Inquisition 2.0
- They're here investigating something supernatural
	- What would satisfy that investigation
- Ways to influence one or both of the investigators
	- Dominate? = Boons
- Is there any way that one might be able to explain the current situation in a way that doesn't point at vampires?
- How do we manipulate the humans without alerting the Lasombra?

Heading back to the estate
- Note just inside the door
	- Addressed to Carlo
	- Lorenzo (guard) - Inquisitors grilled him about the investigation; didn't tell them anything spooky, but they are likely suspicious.
- Sorin is not there
- Salamah thinks of a plan that involves the szlachta
	- Can we find Sorin?
- Andrea brings his dogs to hopefully sniff out Sorin
	- 3 dogs show up - one is a bloodhound
	- Head to Sorin's shop to help the dogs track Sorin

Balc answers the door at the shop
- Suspicious of us
- Andrea tells him who we are and that we're looking for Sorin because we haven't seen him since the explosion
- Balc says he's seen Sorin since, and Sorin is well
	- He's probably in his lab
	- Doesn't know where that is
- Andrea asks if there's anything of Sorin's that the dogs can smell
- Balc says no - he's lying (only Salamah catches it - and alerts the others)
- Andrea tries asking nicely
	- Balc tries to close the door
	- Andrea gets his foot in to stop it
	- Carlo reaches out for the doorknob and yanks the door open
		- Pulls Balc by the door out into the street
		- Salamah - "Would you like to try again?"
		- Balc squares up and thinks about fighting, then realizes that Salamah is definitely NOT HUMAN!! and stops
		- Salamah asks for access to something the dogs can sniff to find Sorin
		- Balc lets the dogs in
- Bloodhound finds A scent, but the wrong one
- Kerberos is the goodest boi and finds the right scent - sets off tracking
	- Notes attached to each dog's collar to get Sorin to come meet us near the guard house with his "friend"
- Kerberos comes back and alerts Andrea to follow him
- Andrea takes off, opens the catacomb door, and then continues along after the dog
- Carlo and Salamah follow a little confusedly - this wasn't the plan, but okay
- Heading for the chantry
	- Manage to not set off a fire sigil (Carlo is now an acrobat)
- Sorin doesn't hear us enter
- Very hoarse and muffled attempts at screaming
- Andrea is PISSED
- Convince Sorin to use the szlachta as bait - Salamah wrote a blank boon cheque (Sorin asks for a Lesser Boon)
- Carlo goes to find Lorenzo to start the plan

The plan:
- Make the szlachta all shadowy
- Get Lorenzo to draw the guards to where bait is or where they'll be so we can stage an attack
- Stage an attack
- Hopefully the inquisitors battle and/or win against the szlachta
- One may die, that's okay

Carlo talks to his ghoul, and works to set up a scene that will hopefully convince the inquisitors
- Carlo appears to have been attacked by the szlachta
- The inquisitors run at the szlachta
- One tries to kick it, but it sturdy AF and stabs him back
- Blood is everywhere
- That inquisitor begins to die
- The other charges the szlachta
- They trade blows
- Carlo gets up to help against the szlachta
- The Inquisitor makes him out to be a Cainite and attacks him
- The szlachta skewers the inquisitor
- Carlo lets them both die

The coterie decides to stage it as though one inquisitor betrayed the other
Andrea goes invisible with one of the bodies and heads off, trailing some blood, through the catacombs

Salamah tries to write an incriminating letter about the inquisitor they took (the "traitor"), but it's too difficult so she tries to get Carlo to do it.
- He asks his ghoul some questions and tries to write a reasonable letter

Andrea gets to Guidobaldo's sitting room where he appears to be waiting
- Thanks Andrea for the use of his ghoul
- Andrea asks about the history of the Tzimisce and the Lasombra in the city
	- Tzimisce don't have a history in the city
	- Lasombra history is complicated
		- For about a century the Lasombra ruled the city
		- Marcus had left the city in the charge of his seneschal
		- Guidobaldo will answer any other questions
