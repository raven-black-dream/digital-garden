### Game Start

Game Recap
Sorin
- Regrows his hand - floppy glove
- Heals some damage
- Goes in search of food
	- Exits the catacombs
	- In a park at the north end of the city
	- Several people in the park
		- Lone male leaving
		- Sorin shoves him into an alley - takes him roughly from behind and feeds
- Goes to look for Balc - he is not in crisis
	- Sorin will be attending some personal business, asks Balc to pass a message along to the estate
- Goes back to the chantry to try and talk to gargoyles
	- Methodical search around the chantry
	- Finds a well, leaves it
	- Continues down stairs
	- Finds another well - pulls up the bucket, it's full of water
		- Marks the bucket
	- Continues on - find 'person-sized' cages (uncomfy sized) - specimen cages
	- The well is weird
	- Goes through another door and finds a large cavern
		- Large horde of gargoyles
		- Sorin's beast is urging him to leave
		- He manages to sneak away without alerting the gargoyles
	- Checks out the stairs and where they lead
	- This floor seems more like the upper levels - more round
	- Ritual rooms, skeletons, many piles of dust
	- On his way out, checks the other well - bucket is unmarked
- Heads back to the estate

Sorin arrives just after Lucia leaves
We have a hunger shade to hunt down in the merchant quarter
- Andrea has burn holes and some singeing - smells like smoke
- Sorin is quite blood covered
- Carlo had changed and Salamah's clothes were fine
- Andrea and Sorin change
	- When Andrea changes, he hears a thump - a small scroll with a familiar signet ring fell to the floor when he undid his belt
	- Note from Francesco
	- Reads it
Once everyone is presentable we head to the merchant quarter
- Plan for Carlo and Andrea to talk to people
	- Sorin and Salamah investigate areas (with Carlo and Andrea's help)

Andrea - seeing vibrant auras around the piazza - a little overstimulated
Salamah - shadows here don't seem tainted, people don't seem overtly afraid

In a small greenspace with marble walkways and a fountain - Andrea is in wonder at how colourful and vibrant everything is
Carlo stops and checks in with Andrea
Salamah and Andrea are in agreement that it doesn't seem like the shadow was there
Continue on somewhat methodically
Salamah senses the Abyss down an alley, hears some whispers. Andrea also hears whispers, listens harder
- Sounds like a crime scene
Salamah creeps down the alleyway - isn't noticed
- City guard is walking around making notes about a couple of corpses in the alley
	- Torn apart is an accurate description
	- Sense of the abyss is stronger
	- Sees something slip from the roof above - roughly human shape, weird silhouette - lands on guard
		- Andrea sees it too - sees that it's 3D, odd protrusion from his chest
	- Salamah watches to see what happens while Andrea hurries up
	- The guard is unconscious or dead with a shape on top of him - doesn't seem to be doing anything
	- Salamah steps out of the shadow as Andrea rushes up
		- Dead body with a knife sticking out of its chest, body didn't bleed
	- Andrea goes to shift the corpse off the guard
	- Guard groans and opens his eyes blearily
	- Salamah tries to back into the shadows
- Guard talking about multiple corpses around town - two torn apart, two others
- Andrea asks if the guard has any leads
	- Guard says he's supposed to be asking the questions
- Carlo approaches at this point - turns on Awe to be trustworthy
- Guard becomes less suspicious
- Convince the guard that he's injured and should go get checked out while Andrea and Carlo finish up his notes here
- Guard gets up, slips, and keels back over into the sludge
- Carlo helps him up - pulls the guard towards himself and sinks his fangs into the guard's neck
- Andrea lunges for Carlo to try and stop him - hunger frenzies on Carlo
- Sorin uses Celerity to try and help - hunger frenzies on Andrea
- Salamah cuts and runs
- Sorin manages to tear himself away from Andrea, and pushes him away
- Andrea has a mild vinculum rating to Carlo, Sorin has a strong vinculum rating to Andrea - for the next lunar month (Nov 4, 1515)
- Carlo ghouls the guard, Salamah is gone
- Sorin offers Andrea a hand up, Andrea is still out of it, Sorin picks him up by the shoulders and leads him away from the gore - picks him up and carries him
- Carlo tells the guard some basics and gets him to meet the following evening
- Group of three finds the nearest entrance to the catacombs, heads back to the estate
- Andrea comes to somewhat being carried by Sorin - floppy hand

Salamah
- Goes to find Pietro - explains what she can, points out they alley on a map
- Pietro extorts as much detail as he can about why Salamah came to him about this
