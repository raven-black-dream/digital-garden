## Character Specific Notes
### Andrea
* Learning More Auspex
* Francesco - Contact
* Lucia gets herself in trouble (*sigh Ghouls*)
* Fratellino

### Carlo
- Relationship with Leonello - strained
- Relationship with Alessandra
- Not joining the rebellion
	- Saw the elders in Florence stand up to the Inquisition in a very real way
	- Doesn't want to be a pawn in another coup - very hesitant to be involve in additional rebellions
	- Doesn't want to be unknowingly used

### Salamah
- Settling in
- Trying to find a place for herself in a city that doesn't _like her very much_.
- Running from Milan


### Sorin
- Seeking to settle in - Experimentation on others -> Potential for some drama
	- Not sure how that will form up yet. Probably to be found in play.
- Sorin should feel a bit lost.
- Has been fixing himself from what his sire did to him originally
	- Appearance 1
	- Was an average looking human - give them an uncanny valley look
- Left Bucharest 24 months prior to game
- Florence - thought it was far enough away, and his retainer wanted to go
- Sets up a shop
- Once Prince isn't going to kill/expel him, get a domain to be able to start experimentation
- Did remember to reach out to Marcus before entering the city

## Character Interactions
- Carlo doing reserach in the library - Anarch revolt
- Carlo occasionally crashes at the manor
- Andrea thinking of Carlo as an annoying house guest
- Higher ups thinking that Andrea and Carlo work well together so tend to force them together
