### Game Start

Recap

Salamah
- Tasks from Lena
	- Spying on Brother Antonio
	- Pick up a letter
- Feeds on Nosfertu - he's starting to go insane - puts him in torpor
- Performs Eyes of the Abyss ritual to gain an abyssal servant - gives it instructions to report every other night and gives details info on Brother Antonio and Elysium before dropping it off near Elysium.
- Goes to pick up a note from a basement that is connected to the Catacombs
	- Sees a note in the open, seal is unfamiliar to Salamah
- Takes the note back to Lena
	- Salamah is irritated and her hackles are up so she's a little more short and snippy
	- Lena stares her down, Salamah stares back, makes extended eye contact (Mistakes were Made)
	- Lena uses Dominate to make Salamah crawl and give Lena the note
	- Salamah drops to the ground and begins to crawl before gritting her teeth and fighting through to stand up and finish walking
	- Note has fang puncture marks
	- Lena and Salamah trade a few verbal blows before Salamah acquiesces
	- Lena dismisses her and she leaves to head back to the estate

Andrea
- Goes to see Zohan - he's lecturing Andrea on the finer points of Italian music and performance - not trying to get Andrea to imbibe this time it seems

Carlo
- Goes to talk to Lorenzo to see if there is any news
	- Lorenzo is Lieutenant now
	- He's doing paperwork - complaints of a truant officer
		- Carlo says he'll go check it out
		- Can't find the guy
- Goes feeding - but can't find anything/anyone
		- Streets are more empty
		- Bars are empty and/or closed early
- Goes to talk to his brother
	- Asks how his brother would feel about becoming more involved in city politics
	- He'll look into it
- Returns to the estate

Coterie
- Andrea returns to the estate
- Salamah returns second, goes to her room and screams into a pillow before going to talk to Andrea
- Discussion of their evenings - Carlo returns
- Panicked knocking at the library door
	- Lucia is standing there, white as a sheet and hyperventilating
	- Andrea takes her to a nearby quiet room to ask what happened
		- Lucia saw Salamah pick up the note, and in an attempt to ensure Salamah didn't spot her, she went into another room and saw a guy dead in a pool of his own blood
		- Probably the ghoul she'd been looking for over the last few days
		- Lucia's hands are covered in blood - large knife wound
		- Andrea's beast is distracted by the blood
		- Lucia offers her wrist, Andrea feeds
		- Less distracted - more discussion about what happened
		- Probably going to investigate more before talking to Guidobaldo
		- Decide to ask Salamah about her evening
- Andrea and Lucia return to the library
	- Asking about Salamah's evening
	- Salamah refuses to answer, despite blunt questions
	- Salamah asks to speak to Andrea alone
	- They move to another room
		- Salamah mentions she doesn't trust Lucia
		- But yes, she did pick up a letter for Lena that evening
		- Body is probably Lena's missing ghoul
		- Andrea knows who Lucia was dropping the note off for, but it's probably for the best that he not say anything
		- Salamah says they should tell Carlo so his men in the guard can find the body and not someone random
- Return to talk to Carlo - decide to go investigate tonight

Coterie heads to the house with the body
- There is a body in a pool of blood
- The body has been rolled over
- Investigation
	- Andrea finds a trail of blood that leads out the door
	- Carlo looks over the body - stabbed wtih a common Italian blade
	- Salamah finds a petty cash strongbox in the entry way - pops the lock easily - almost embarrassingly easily
		- She does not relock it before putting it aside
	- Lucia is standing around a little awkwardly, waiting for instructions, but seems to be doing alright otherwise
- Follow the blood trail out
	- End up in an alley in a rough part of town
	- Lena would never send her ghoul here
	- There are brothels and seedy taverns a-plenty
- Salamah is going to deliver the news to Lena
	- Will not hide how she knows this info
- Carlo will prepare a letter for his men if he needs to alert them

Salamah heads to Lena's salon
- Ghoul answers - Salamah is allowed in fairly quickly
- Lena was not expecting her - definitely was a bad time - barely wearing anything
- Salamah delivers the news as efficiently as she can
- Lena asks questions about what Salamah knows and Salamah obliges
- Salamah says that her coterie-mate has people in the guard if Lena would like them to look into it
- Lena agrees - would owe our coterie a boon if the investigation were to reveal anything about why he was killed or by who
- Lena leaves first - do not disappoint her - her rage is palpable, the ghoul was important to her
- Salamah returns to the estate

	- Should tell Guidobaldo about the complications
	- Andrea and Lucia go to do that and then return
- Salamah returns to the estate and talks about Lena
- Discussion around whether it would be a good idea to write the letter of introduction - decide to talk to Pietro the next day
- Carlo wakes up Borso and explains everything and gives him letters for the guard

Thomas the rat runs into the room and runs up Andrea's leg - whispers to Andrea that 'abd found Sorin in his haven
- Andrea has a look of horror
