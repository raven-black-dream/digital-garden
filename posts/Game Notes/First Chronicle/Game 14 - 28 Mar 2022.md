### GM Notes

- [ ] Carlo owes a boon to Andrea
- [ ] Giovanna owes Pietro (unrecorded)
- [ ] Andrea was talking to the hunters - asked for the story of the hunt ‘for a friend’
- [ ] Giovanna has 2 road points to drop before game 15
- [ ] Giovanna probably gets a derangement - botched frenzy
- [ ] Adapted Frenzy Rules
	- [ ] Wake up checks get easier as smoke turns to fire
	- [ ] Also easier if NPCs are attempting to help them wake up
	- [ ] Smoke - one check, if you don’t get enough you can stay still and try again but the fire potentially gets worse
	- [ ] Fire - another check even if they made a smoke one, cannot stay still if the threshold isn’t met - immediate frenzy
	- [ ] Carlo + Giovanna - if they managed to not frenzy, one final basic check to maintain control once they’re safe
	- [ ] Waiting around luck check to see if the fire gets worse (for anyone spending at least a round not escaping)
  

### Pre-Game

- [ ] XP spending?
  

### Plot

- [ ] Context fiction - perhaps mention smoke drifting over the city
  
- [ ] Fire started on the second floor
  
- [ ] One of the Marcos and/or one of the Francos are dead
  
- [ ] A crowd followed the inquisition out and is watching the manor burn
  
- [ ] Andrea
	- [ ] Sleeping on first floor near staff
	- [ ] Lucia - probably trying to get to/help Andrea; extremely clingy after the fire
	- [ ] If Andrea doesn’t encounter her, perhaps the imp brings Andrea to Lucia or Lucia to Andrea later
	- [ ] Maria - probably hesitates before leaving
	- [ ] Luca - probably trying to help staff escape through the catacombs
	- [ ] Ernst is either in the catacombs or his chapel - probably fine even if no one alerts him
  

- [ ] Carlo
- [ ] First or second floor?
- [ ] Most of his men are dead
- [ ] 5 went to go protect him (His two main guys plus 3 others)
- [ ] Probable frenzy, maybe killing his men
  
- Giovanna
- [ ] On the second floor
- [ ] The inquisition had let Piero enter
- [ ] General plan is escape, regroup, figure out what’s next

- [ ] Potential options for what’s next
- [ ] Fight the inquisition
- [ ] Go find new lodgings/hide until they’re strong again
- [ ] Potential for diablerie to happen this game
- [ ] Something crazy and player driven
  

### Game Start

Florence is tense

Smoke near sunset

Andrea wakes in a closet

Smells smoke - beast is wide awake

Room is full of smoke - succeeds frenzy check

Noise of people moving quickly

Moves into the courtyard - roof is on fire

There is yelling outside

Luca is by the entrance to the catacombs, gesturing people down the stairs

Andrea goes over

Carlo is still asleep

Andrea asks Luca what’s going on

- Inquisition attacked, the men are holding them off somewhat, but they threw something up on the roof

Maria and Lucia are missing, asks Andrea to go find them

Andrea turns on heightened senses and goes looking

Giovanna wakes to Piero shaking her - there’s fire everywhere

Piero is leading her out onto the balcony to escape when she frenzies at the sight of fire

Tosses Piero over the balcony (he takes 2 superficial damage)

Carlo finally wakes because Leonello is shaking him

Carlo manages to hold his frenzy - heads out with his men into the smoke

He manages to barely hold on when he sees fire - one willpower down

~Missing Details~

Andrea finds Maria in a room staring at the burning ceiling

No frenzy - tells Maria to run to the crypt now

Maria curtsies and runs to the crypt

Still looking for Lucia

Imp says that we can find her - Andrea keeps looking while the imp offers help

Giovanna goes over the railing as well, lands fine and shatters the marble floor, runs towards the stable

Carlo uses Celerity to catch her, she’s spitting mad, a feral animal and tries to eat his face, but he restrains her

Andrea is still looking for Lucia

Imp keeps offering to get her otherwise Andrea will burn

Andrea tells the imp to get Lucia to the crypt door and he’ll meet them there

When Andrea gets down to the crypt Lucia appears with a pop and the smell of sulphur

Grabs Lucia’s wrist and pulls her down to the crypt

Luca saw Carlo run off but doesn’t know where Giovanna is

Lucia doesn’t appear to be fully with it

Andrea asks Lucia to stay with the others while he goes looking for Giovanna and Carlo

Giovanna holds herself together enough to Dominate Carlo out of her way. She runs towards the woods, he runs towards the front area

Andrea watches Carlo/Giovanna run in opposite directions

Andrea runs after Giovanna since Carlo is in Celerity

Andrea tries to calm her, but it doesn’t work and Giovanna keeps running

Carlo runs towards the front, sees the Inquisition standing over the bodies of his dead friends

Carlo goes into fury frenzy and starts murdering

He kills/injures 8 men, grabs an injured one and goes to heal and feed - kills the one he fed on

As he turns back to the battle, a man wearing monk robes steps forward and mutters a prayer (Psalm 23:4-6)

Carlo runs in fear from the truly faithful - heads into the catacombs

Andrea can’t catch Giovanna, so heads back to the catacombs himself

Finds the hidden door ajar - leaves it ajar for anyone coming in after

Giovanna runs until she can come out of frenzy. She goes to loop around the city to another entrance

Carlo gets to the crypt - hears footsteps and something dragging behind him

- Borso limps in dragging a somewhat conscious Leonello back towards Carlo
- Borso has an arrow in his thigh, Leonello has a penetrative injury to his ribs
  

Head down - seals the entrance to keep the Inquisition from following

Checks on Leonello - arrow passed through his ribcage - not looking good

Tries to bandage the wound as best he can and carries him out of there

Borso finds footprints leading to a small room with a bookshelf that looks ajar

They head through the hidden door

Andrea catches up to the staff - Luca isn’t sure where to go

There are several staff missing

Trying to figure out where the staff can go, whether they can pay for places for the staff to stay

Takes the staff to a place across the river, tells Luca what the street is

Andrea goes to feed from Maria before they go - Lucia tries to offer but Andrea says no so she looks very dejected

Andrea and Luca agree to meet in the library the next night

Andrea tries to leave and Lucia doesn’t want to let go

Andrea convinces her to let go by agreeing to have her come to the library with Luca the next day

Giovanna heads to her sire’s house for safe haven

They argue

Her sire slaps her and tells her to know her betters

Giovanna attacks him and drives him to his knees, tells him to know his betters, and diablerizes him

Carlo is still carrying Leonello, runs into Andrea

They head to Elysium and straight to Pietro

There is nothing that can be done for Leonello save embracing him

Pietro tells Carlo and Borso to leave, but asks to talk to Andrea

Pietro plans to embrace Leonello

Andrea leaves to catch up with Carlo

Back to Giovanna - struggled with sire’s soul - she won

Pounding on the door - Seneschal, on his knees with tears - what have you done? Then he collapses unconscious

Giovanna ghouls him while he’s unconscious

Takes a corpse tour of the house
