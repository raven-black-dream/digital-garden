Giovanna sinned against her Road and loses a point
Giovanna heads out to feed
On her way home, runs into the hunter whose brain she broke
	- Unwashed, staggering, pitiful wreck
	- Doesn’t recognize him at first
When he finally sees her, he rejoices and prostrates himself to kiss her boots

Giovanna wrenches her boot away, tells him to stand and starts walking away
He follows
WTF does she do?
