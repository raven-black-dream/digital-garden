# Game Start

Rewind to when Andrea left in order to follow Carlo’s evening

Carlo and Borso talk about what happened

Carlo heals an Agg - Beast gets hungry again

Andrea comes from talking with Pietro - Carlo owes Pietro a lot, but nothing in particular yet, and don’t tell Veronica

Leonello is getting turned - will be some version of Nosferatu - “He was the ugliest of us anyway”

Andrea heads off to the events of [[Game 15 - 4 Apr 2022]]

Elysium is quiet

Borso is tense - He wants to go avenge his brothers and he’s waiting with Carlo

Could go lay waste now just them, or could gather an army

Hears voices outside

Gets in a defensive position with a sword


Andrea and Giovanna enter Elysium

Carlo has up-ended the table

Quick catch-up conversation

Should talk to the Scourge about the army

Giovanna heads off to the Scourge and the others follow

Giovanna knocks and the door jerks open - armoured scourge answers

They enter - Scourge stops Borso until Carlo interjects that he’s a ghoul

Conversation around what happened at the manor and what’s next

Discussion of the army

Giovanna starts planning a war - Carlo is on board

Andrea is surprised at Giovanna but not at Carlo - asks if the Scourge has a plan

Scourge asks Giovanna about Diablerie in a round-about using the text of Hakim way

Giovanna answers affirmatively and the Scourge chuckles

Giovanna redirects back to Andrea’s question about a plan

Scourge doesn’t have any more details about the strength of the Inquisition

Do we strike tonight, or wait and risk reinforcements

Scourge can gather forces in an hour - gives an intersection in the catacombs to meet

Andrea and Carlo go to find food

- Go to the farm where they got cows before
- Carlo drains a cow, Andrea just takes one from a couple cows
- Carlo looks like he won an eating competition, but he didn’t lose control so he’s not covered in blood
- Carlo goes to hide the cow corpse in the woods
  

Giovanna heals (and gets hungrier) and goes in search of weaponry

- Posh house, posh neighbourhood
- Paolo
- Servant opens the door - Master is engaged and he’s reluctant to interrupt
- Paolo comes out completely naked - they talk business and Paolo leaves to put pants on and takes her to the armoury
- She selects weaponry for all three of them and armour for herself
- Feeds on Paolo
- Leaves with a house servant and a cart full of weaponry
  

- Arms for herself, Carlo, and Andrea
- Armour for herself
- Giovanna can’t find the intersection to save her life

- Passing the intersection repeatedly, but isn’t seeing it
- Andrea is there and calling for her but she cannot hear/understand him
  
Giovanna offers up the arsenal - Andrea selects a few things

Carlo arrives and selects some stuff from the arsenal

Where is Borso?

Scourge arrives with someone with him wearing similar armour to ‘Abd - carrying a chest - plus some Brujah and the other Carlo (Gangrel)

The extra person is Borso and he gives the chest to Carlo

- Extra armour for Carlo
- Also found blueprints for the church and hung out with ‘Abd
Giovanna offers arsenal to everyone else who showed up

Going to save combat for next game
