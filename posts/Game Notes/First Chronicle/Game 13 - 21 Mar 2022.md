### Game Start

Florence - tensions are high, Inquisition is in town

#### Giovanna 

wakes up hungry and approaching the bottom of her road - the beast knows she’s weak

#### Andrea
- Imp is sitting on Andrea’s foot when he wakes up
- Reading a book - commenting on it
- It’s Maria’s journal - was probably writing until she fell asleep and then the imp took it
- Andrea reads it - a very emotional recounting of Giovanna instructing Maria to drag Leonardo (the Seneschal) from the house. A hooded man helps at the end. Many emotions about not being able to talk about it
- Imp is jumping around trying to get into things and being bored
- Maria expresses relief about being able to write about it and gratitude towards Andrea
- Andrea guesses who the hooded man is (Pietro)
- Andrea decides to give the book back to Maria
- Imp is frustrated that Andrea seems to be ignoring all of his wisdom and infernal knowledge
- Humans/mages get his name wrong all the time. So the imp (and others like him) give them exactly what they want, to the letter.
- Offers to make Maria and/or Lucia his
- He does Andrea favours in hopes that Andrea will do him a favour back
- Andrea never asked for any favours - isn’t quite sure what to make of the imp
- Andrea goes to return the book - Maria doesn’t wake up

#### Carlo
- Wakes up and goes to heal damage - gets hungrier
- Goes to the yard for training
  
#### Giovanna
- Awakes to a rather irritated Piero
- Inquisition is building a pyre in the square near the church
- Business is bad today due to the tension
- Message from the Scourge - angry at the Prince
- Gives Piero the message back to burn and a message for the seneschal of her sire’s estate
- It’s just a distraction to keep him away from the pyre and knowing Giovanna is going there
  
Giovanna goes to head out - finds Andrea coming back from returning the book and Carlo in the courtyard practicing.

Carlo puts himself through a gruelling set of drills.

Giovanna brings up the pyre - may be Brother Thomas or a Kindred

Tells Andrea/Carlo that they can go about their evening if they wish, but both choose to come along

Carlo goes to feed and ask a couple of the men if they wish to come along

- Feeds on Franco, the stablehand (the twitchy one)
- Borzo and another of his men will come along
  
Andrea tells Giovanna to whisper or make a discreet motion if she needs Andrea, and then he turns invisible - gets hungrier, wants to eat Lucia

Giovanna mutters about fucking Nosferatu and then goes and opens the door wide for Andrea to leave easily.

Carlo and his men return - everyone heads to the square

Ever-growing tension in the air as they get closer to the plaza

Brother Thomas is tied to a post in the centre of the pyre with Inquisition guards standing around

Large crowd gathered

Priest/Cardinal dressed in white with a red mantle and cap approaches the pyre - stands at the foot, pacing as the crowd gathers

About 500-1000 in the crowd

Cardinal + ten guards in sight

Cardinal steps out and gives a speech

- Declares war on the children of Satan
  
- Have a servant of the devil on the pyre - once a priest, turned by the children of the beast, those that stalk your streets
  
- Hope to bring the flames for all of the monsters
  
Guards chuck flaming torches into the kindling at the foot of the pyre

Brother Thomas has clearly been tortured, is exhausted, and has given up

All hear Brother Thomas call from behind the flames about “his angel”

Guard stabs him in the ribs, he gurgles and dies

Giovanna chooses to turn and leave

Andrea notices a weirdness in the shadows

Giovanna has the distinct feeling of being watched, but can’t see who is watching

As they exit the plaza - notice that one of the guards is making a beeline for the moving group (Andrea notices first, then Carlo and the guards, then Giovanna)

Andrea moves to not be immediately with the group

Carlo and his men get into a tighter formation around Giovanna

Giovanna keeps walking but aims for more of an alley

Guard asks why they’re leaving - Giovanna appears to have talked her way out of it

Andrea invisibly catches up to the group as they take a circuitous route back to the manor

Eyes and ears open on the trip back

Giovanna decides to stay in the manor, but Carlo and Andrea can continue their evening

Carlo goes out to hang with the boys

Andrea asks if they should tell someone - Giovanna opts to finish writing her note to the Scourge and give it to Andrea to give to the Herald

Andrea heads to Elysium - Veronica catches him despite obfuscate

Andrea turns visible and shrugs at her

She says Nosferatu are usually more polite than that, so he gives a half bow and keeps walking

He goes to find Carlo, the Herald, in his usual spot - they chat about the Inquisition issue

Andrea looks for an exit that doesn’t go past Veronica

There’s an exit through Pietro’s office

Discussion about using blood to encode messages - Pietro will teach Andrea for a favour in return, won’t tell the harpy

Andrea is avoiding Veronica at the moment - she made some odd comments to Giovanna about him

Asks to use the back exit - Pietro says yes, but don’t tell non-family

Andrea heads back to the manor

  

Giovanna is trying to figure out food

Carlo is hanging out with the boys, late night spars, not getting drunk

- Sparring with the men is deeply unsatisfying now, they move too slowly
  
- Ends up watching them spar and giving pointers
  

Andrea gives Giovanna a quick update that the note has been delivered - Carlo and Pietro seem to know what’s going on.

Discussion about the Scourge and the force he’s trying to build - why would it be against the prince etc.

Andrea mentions the shadows

Giovanna realizes it’s possibly the Lasombra

Discussion on the Lasombra ensues

Andrea goes to eat while Giovanna pens another note (blames Andrea for the extra note)

Maria is still asleep

The dice decide Lucia is the next best option lol

Andrea takes one hunger, Lucia tries to nuzzle closer until Andrea mentions he has a note to deliver and she apologizes and leaves

As Lucia leaves, she thanks Andrea and says some too-quiet-to-hear words

Andrea heads off to Giovanna

#### Andrea

Andrea takes the note back to Elysium and to perhaps talk to Pietro about the Lasombra

Heads back through to Pietro’s office

Asks about the Lasombra

Pietro asks whether it’s just one, a couple, or all of them

Andrea explains about the two shadows he saw

The Prince is currently missing - which is unusual

- He’s too young to be prince  
- He rules through business acumen and an intricate knowledge of politics
- But that’s not enough
  

Now it is likely that we wait for the Lasombra to unseat him

Discussion about who the Lasombra are

The Ventrue have made it clear that they rule in Florence, so the Lasombra are not here

Pietro will keep Elysium safe - he can’t promise anything for the city, but he can keep Elysium safe

Andrea heads back to the manor

Giovanna has gone out to eat from her herd - overeats a little, but doesn’t kill them - then returns to the manor

Before Giovanna gets back, Andrea comes back and goes to talk to Carlo

Discusses the Lasombra and the Inquisition - fortify the manor

Giovanna probably went out to feed - but thinks she should have known better than to go out

Carlo goes to figure out guard rotations while they wait for her

Giovanna returns

Discussion about conversation with Pietro

Discussion around fortifying the manor - Giovanna suggests giving the guards torches to help with protection etc

Andrea goes to look for Ernst to ask about fortifying/tell him about possibly arming the staff/guards with fire

Ernst is otherwise unhelpful - he’s gonna pray on things
