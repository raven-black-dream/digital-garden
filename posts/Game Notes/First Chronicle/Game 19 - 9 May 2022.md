Game Start

Recap

Old Conversations

-   Andrea and Luca
-   In the manor, rest of staff just got dismissed
-   Luca approaches Andrea
-   Some knowledge of ghouls

-   Ernst would put it in uneasy terms
    

-   Andrea asks Lucia if she wants to explain what she did
-   “Partially a ghouls” - it’ll wear off if she lets it
-   Lucia can’t imagine letting it wear off
-   Ghouls lose a bit of free will
-   Lucia seems to be enamoured with the idea
-   Seems like Andrea made a choice
    

-   I’d rather she not die (OOC: Yes. That is a choice. Lol)
    

-   Andrea worries Lucia will get herself killed
-   Lucia thought she had lost everything
-   Andrea sits, Luca sits in a chair, Lucia sits on the floor next to Andrea
-   Andrea tells her not to do it again, Lucia is sincere when she says she won’t
-   Luca - why did you want to talk about ghouls?
    

-   No ulterior motives?
-   Ernst was not stereotypical, but Giovanna is and Carlo isn’t stereotypical yet - he knows how it works
-   Knows Giovanna killed his father
    

-   Talked with Maria “about her journal”
-   Probably saved her life
-   Journal probably burned in the manor fire
    

-   Andrea apologizes for Giovanna’s actions
-   Luca asks why Andrea has no plans for him
    

-   Andrea didn’t want to ghoul Lucia
-   Ernst didn’t ghoul anyone for religious reasons

-   Are they still in service to Ernst?
-   Ernst is probably still in his chapel - though Andrea has sent a letter to inform him of the new home
-   Ernst didn’t spend as much constant time in the chapel before
-   Wonders what is troubling him
    

-   Andrea praises Luca for acting well in an emergency and getting everyone he could out - that makes him a good seneschal, ghoul or not
    
-   Andrea seems to care about the staff - everyone else sees them as a food source
-   Andrea tells Luca about how Giovanna got the manor
-   Luca knows about Amaranth
-   Andrea tells Luca to be careful around Giovanna
-   Luca asks if the staff is safe
-   Andrea doesn’t think she’s able to feed off of the staff
    

-   Explains Giovanna’s feeding restrictions as best he can
-   Luca realizes that’s where his father’s stipend likely came from

-   Luca looks around the library and mutters something in Latin
-   Beware of Greeks bearing gifts
    
-   Andrea looks for Lucia

-   Didn’t see her leave, but can’t see her
-   Asks Luca if he saw her leave
-   Lucia pipes up that she’s right there
-   She’s there now
    

-   Andrea looks around - There is nothing particularly weird or supernatural in the room, except for something sort of wispy around Lucia - dissipating
-   Andrea is unsettled - Lucia was just trying to be quiet - Andrea keeps a hand on her shoulder
-   Luca needs to speak to the staff and would like to speak to Andrea the following evening
    

-   Need to decide what the acceptable risk is
-   Giovanna shows up
    

-   Recognizes what happened with Lucia
-   Snatches the note from Andrea - reads it, crumples the paper
-   Starts pacing

-   Luca has moved away from Giovanna
-   Muttering about why they would take the ghouls
    

-   Go to check on Borso
-   Giovanna throws the door across the room
-   Borso tries to stake her - just barely misses
    

-   He is mortified
    

-   Borso owes Giovanna a dress and something else - maybe through Carlo
-   Andrea offers to get the dogs to search for the ghouls
-   It’s late, so that’s probably the best option - maybe Veronica will know where the Lasombra are
    

  

Past conversations

-   Giovanna and ‘Abd
-   Side effects of Amaranth
-   Stress probably brought on the problem
-   Meditation
-   Asks ‘Abd if he’s ever had unwanted presences in his head
    

-   The first
-   So it gets easier?
-   Or it changes you
    

-   Warning against doing it too often
-   ‘Abd leads her in a guided meditation
    
-   Before she leaves she asks what will happen when/if someone finds out what she’s done - will he be ordered to give her her final death?
-   Perhaps, depends on who discovers her and what they do with that information
-   Giovanna doesn’t regret her decision
-   The blood of Haqim should be kept from the unworthy
