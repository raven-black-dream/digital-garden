Recap

Group is heading to the church

Plan is for the city defenders to take out the outside guard, while Carlo, Andrea, and Giovanna head inside to deal with the inquisition proper

Cristoforo takes control of Giovanna

G/C goes and tears a side door off

Carlo tries to get G/C to stay with the group, but Cristoforo is not a ‘teamwork’ person

Andrea is invisible and tries to stay removed from the loud group

Three priests come towards us. G/C tries to dominate but it doesn’t work

True Faith Activate

Borso goes for the leader

4th guy goes for Andrea and can obviously see him, Andrea tries to shoot him and misses

Giovanna brings a knife to a mace duel

Carlo kills one of them and goes to help Giovanna

Andrea goes to bite the guy he’s fighting

G/C tries to use Dread Gaze, but Giovanna doesn’t have it so dude just laughs

Dude swings the mace again - does some Agg but yay for Fortitude soaking some

Inquisitor takes a swing at Borso - misses

Inquisitor 4 (with Andrea) tries to break his grip and cannot

Borso takes a swing at his dude

Carlo attempts to drive mace-dude’s head into the ground - cracks the marble with the head

G/C hunger frenzies, Carlo holds her off

Inquisitor 4 holds a cross to Andrea’s face, burns him and he backs off

Inquisitor 1 goes after Borso

Carlo throws G/C towards the Inquisitor that Andrea is fighting either to have her eat the Inquisitor or have Andrea soothe her - SO MANY SUCCESSES

G/C lands on the inquisitor, his cross burns into her neck, she drains him dry (OOC: feels a little profane to envision this lol)

Andrea looks nearby for anyone left in the building

G/C finishes draining the inquisitor, Andrea mentions they should go search, G/C has opinions about Nosferatu and says that yes Andrea should do that.

Carlo tries to get G/C to come along, and it comes out that Cristoforo is the one in control

Andrea is already halfway down the stairs when Carlo convinces G/C that they wouldn’t want Andrea to get all the glory would they?

Torture equipment in the basement - “the home gym of the inquisition” (OOC: Hmm…kinky.)

Building seems to be empty and it’s quiet outside

Carlo climbs up to a window - courtyard is awash in blood but it doesn’t look like any Kindred fell or any Kindred there at all

They all walk out to a mess outside

Andrea looks for where the Kindred went - bloody footsteps towards the catacombs

Footprints head back to the meeting place - everyone appears to be there still

Andrea asks whether we’ll be getting the mess cleaned up or leave it for the mortals to find

G/C is sneering with contempt at ‘Abd, but Giovanna wins the willpower contest and comes back to the moment that Carlo is telling ‘Abd that Giovanna went insane and describes the fact that she was referring to herself with a different name

‘Abd tries to shut Carlo up with a hand, and Giovanna commands him to stop talking

- They will talk about this later
  

‘Abd sends the rest of the group home - asks whether Giovanna has additional mortals to assist in clean up - facepalms when Giovanna mentions a second ghoul acquired tonight

‘Abd heads towards his office and Giovanna and Andrea follows

Carlo asks Borso to help with the clean up then follows the others

‘Abd is writing notes furiously and talking at Giovanna and Andrea

‘Abd asks if Andrea has any rat ghouls handy - he has one conveniently in his pocket

Quinn the rat scurries off with a bunch of notes to the Nosferatu section of the catacombs

‘Abd stares at Giovanna - we’re going to talk later, but not in front of Andrea

Group heads off to new house

Andrea can smell the faintest whiff of blood through the entire house

Giovanna offers a sitting room for the other two while she finds her ghouls sitting in the library

- They have just finished sweeping up Cristoforo’s ashes
  
- Thousand yard stare, resignation
  
- Both agree to go to the church to clean up
  

Andrea and Carlo are exploring slightly - but staying close to the sitting room

- Poke their heads into Giovanna’s old room
- Midnight hues
- Evidence of her changing earlier
- More feminine
- When they hear Giovanna’s footsteps they head back to the sitting room
  

Giovanna explains she diablerized her sire and the side-effects

Carlo suggests he could maybe diablerize Giovanna and gain both souls

Andrea is scrutinizing both Carlo and Giovanna
