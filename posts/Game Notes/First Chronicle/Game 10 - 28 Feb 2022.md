### Game Start

Game recap

Carlo and Giovanna speak about Veronica

Carlo starts to teach Giovanna how to fight - starting with a knife - she acquiesces but doesn’t really learn much

Carlo tries to repair his relationship with Andrea and once he learns how to read tries to interact with Andrea in the library etc.
- Talk about lupines and how Carlo shouldn’t try to get himself killed for a couple centuries
- Carlo says “I just want to learn how to fight them. If you know how to fight them, you won’t get killed”
- ~*infallible logic*~
  

#### Time skip details

##### Andrea
- Visiting Nico’s library a bunch 
- Disappears for a bit, comes back and hanging out with animals a lot
- Not really avoiding Giovanna, but not really around a lot
  
##### Carlo  
- Spends a lot of time out
- A lot of time training with the Brujah
- A lot of time at the library learning about Kindred/Lupine lore
- Barracks are nearly complete, men are sniffing around for contracts
- Goes out with his men once or twice a week, comes back late and tipsy

##### Giovanna
- First couple weeks
	- Condescending/patronizing to Carlo’s fight practice
	- Not much going on

- After Scourge talk
  - Calmer, more present, more engaged
  - Doesn’t seem to hate fight practice anymore
  - Seems happier
  

#### Florence by day

Sun sets

#### Giovanna speaks with Piero
- His apprenticeship is going well
- Brother Thomas is still preaching in the streets and gaining attention
- No luck finding another person to ghoul
  

Talked with the Scourge last week, dodging the Prince

#### Carlo wakes up
- Goes to train in the courtyard
- Checks on the progress of the barracks

#### Andrea wakes up
- Goes to feed on a staff member - finds Maria who is *fine*
- Wanders the manor and talks to Luca
- Heads back towards the crypt
  

As Giovanna goes to leave, the door opens and the scourge comes in without waiting for an invitation. Andrea and Carlo are nearby.

There is someone we need to check on for him - someone goes every year and this year is our turn. 

- She has a territory out on the edge of the city-state - near the border of Medina   
- About 2 nights travel
- She is a gangrel
- There is a lupine territory nearby, and she’s never had any problem, but still good to check
- There are a few way houses to stay at along route - hands us a map

Scourge leaves

Debate about horses

Maybe we’ll take a cart

Giovanna goes to feed - herd

Giovanna leaves a note for Piero in their dead drop

Andrea informs the staff (Luca and Lucia) and some of his animals that they’re leaving

Cerberus is coming with, obviously

Carlo sends a note to his men detailing that he’s leaving the city for a few days

Carlo goes to make friends with the horses - actually manages to

Decide to have Carlo ride, Andrea drive the cart, and Giovanna to ride in the cart

Away we go

  

Travel

- Make the wayhouses well enough before sunrise  
- No problems! That’s not going to be an issue at all!

Gangrel

- Turn off the road onto a practically non-existent path
- Must unmount to carry on
- Nowhere to really leave the horses out here in the middle of nowhere
- Return the horses to the last wayhouse
- Walk back to the path - Giovanna is barefoot
- Walking along Andrea catches the sight of large posts with giant wolf-like skulls
- Points them out to the others
- Are those skulls too big to be a wolf?
- Come across a good gap between posts and a little path
- The woods elsewhere is full of life, but here it’s silent, free from animal/insect sounds
- Giovanna is not really paying attention, Carlo is somewhat distracted, Andrea kind of gets a prickling sensation and Cerberus’ hackles rise
- 11 ft tall, humanoid wolf unfolds from the shadows immediately behind us
- Cerberus hides behind Andrea
- Andrea gestures back towards wolf, but only Carlo notices, Giovanna is still distracted
- Andrea and Carlo watch a small woman attack the lupine from behind, tear its throat out and then tear its head off in one move
- Is Giovanna a well-wrapped present? Lol
- Are you here for the teeth?
- Puts the lupine head on a spike, then drags the rest of the corpse off towards a cabin
- Leave the dog, it will bother the cat
- There’s a lynx - it’s a ghoul
- Gangrel rips off a back leg and gives it to the lynx who chews on it quite happily
- Gangrel (Ashe) invites us into the cabin so she can look for the bag of eyeteeth for inventory
- The bag probably has about 20-30 teeth in it - over two years worth
- Giovanna is ready to go, but the neonates seem to have questions
  

- Carlo - what is the key to fighting lupines?
- Ashe - don’t die.
- Carlo notices Ashe’s claws
- Andrea - can I have a skull
- Ashe - no.
- Andrea - would you take anything in trade?
- Apparently Nico is the only intelligent person in the city
- Will part with a skull for some vitae for the lynx
- Andrea looks to Giovanna to see whether he should do it
- Giovanna doesn’t stop him
- Andrea accepts and Ashe cuts his wrist open over a dish
- Carlo almost frenzies, Ashe tells his beast to sit the fuck down
- Ashe feeds the lynx and gives Andrea a skull
- Lynx shows up to guide us out
- Cerberus is fine
- We head back to the wayhouse
  

- Carlo asking how old Ashe is
- If he gets that old he can end up fighting that well
- Giovanna recommends learning Fortitude and will teach him
- Get back with an hour to spare

[[04-20-1466]]

- All wake up hungrier
- Carlo and Andrea go looking for food
- Carlo finds something, Andrea doesn’t
- Giovanna meditates and then counts the bag of eyeteeth - 25 lupine teeth and a Cainite tooth
- Very bumpy ride to next wayhouse
- Andrea goes to find food - manages to get some without killing anything

- Carlo is SPEEDY - arrives there 3 hours before the cart
