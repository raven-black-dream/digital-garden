### Game Start

Recap
About 30 minutes from dawn

Nosferatu in the house
- Scarred, stooped, seeping wound in his side, horrible scarring down his back (chunks, probably from a lash)
- Standing in a different area than the front door
- Scarring on his head like a crown of thorns
- Absolute exhaustion
  

Giovanna and Nosferatu get pissy at each other
Andrea attempts to introduce everyone
Giovanna snarls and stomps away to shred a pillow and avoid frenzy
Andrea and the Nosferatu talk - this house was his, but he will be hospitable since the prince gave the coterie the house
Ernst will go to bed hungry, but will need to thank the prince for bringing him closer to his god
He has been in torpor and was the crucified Kindred displayed by Elysium
Andrea realizes its his sire
Everyone goes to their rooms to sleep as dawn approaches

- Giovanna talks to Piero
- Gets him to burn her bloody clothes

- Scares the crap out of him - sends him scurrying
- Andrea is figuring out what to do with the dagger - where to stash it?
- Carlo doesn’t have a hangover, yay - learning to read with Borzo

- In Giovanna’s last sip - see the seneschal’s memories
- Including the fact that he was on staff when Ernst lived here
- Andrea is still looking for a place to stash the dagger
- Carlo still trying to learn to read, Borzo cuts things short to stay ahead of Carlo’s temper
- Carlo goes looking for Brujah to spar
- Sees Giovanna, she’s weirdly content/happy
- Andrea finally comes up from the crypt and talks to Giovanna
- Giovanna still weirdly content/happy
- Talk about how to go about investigating - Brother Thomas was a drunk so maybe we should talk to Carlo’s men
- Giovanna thinks she saw something, but it wasn’t anything
- Giovanna and Andrea go to Elysium to find Carlo and/or Pietro
- Carlo ran into Veronica and Veronica convinces him to blow off some steam in a different way
- Giovanna and Andrea show up at Elysium in time to see Carlo and Veronica walking away from Elysium arm in arm
- Veronica makes eye contact at Giovanna and winks, Giovanna smiles in return
- Andrea and Giovanna go look for Pietro
- Pietro says Giovanna has been making some interesting choices and they should chat, asks if Giovanna wants Andrea to join them
- Giovanna wants a private conversation
- Andrea heads to the library and Giovanna goes with Pietro

- Andrea is in the library - just waiting, looking into lupines
- Giovanna can’t find Carlo after her conversation, so goes to find Andrea in the library
- Decide to talk to Nico
- Both Andrea and Giovanna notice his personality shift
- Nico is unhelpful and they leave
- Andrea asks about the hunter that Giovanna rewired
- Giovanna manages to pretend she didn’t kill the dude, but does remember some of his memories from when she rewrote him
- Brother Thomas at an inn ranting about a monstrous woman at the hospital who spat fear into his heart - absolutely hammered
- Find Carlo - he’s very happy
- Carlo knows the inn and between him and Andrea they all get there
- Inn is in a slum, dingy, not Giovanna’s tastes, etc.
- Since Giovanna and Andrea stick out, the plan is to make Giovanna act as though she’s a rich woman looking for a “good time”
- Giovanna hits Awe on walking in - catches everyone’s attention
- Brother Thomas is obvious (white robes, black tabard, drunk)
- Giovanna acts as a distraction while Carlo sits near Brother Thomas
- Brother Thomas asks if Carlo is there to ridicule him
  

- Begins talking about the hellbeast he saw
- Decides he should go tell the church immediately
  

- Carlo intercepts him and takes him back to his room, feeds on him to make sure he sleeps
- There are a lot of books, so Carlo looks outside and waves Andrea in
- Andrea went around the building but didn’t find anything, but comes inside when it looks like Giovanna is still holding the bar’s attention
- Notebook with Brother Thomas’s observations
- Suggest that Giovanna alter his mind
