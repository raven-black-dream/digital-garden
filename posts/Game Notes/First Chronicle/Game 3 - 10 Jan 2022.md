### Game Start

#### Andrea
Pietro finishing lessons with Andrea
Blood Oaths
Feeding
	- Hall Girl in early teens is the servant they find to feed on
	- Pietro demonstrates, girl needs to leave to ‘recover’
Pietro takes Andrea through the catacombs and shows him the main path

#### Giovanna 
Sees the results of Carlo’s cow shenanigans
Waits until the cow splatter stops to approach
Giovanna’s beast kicks in and she sees Nico as a threat
Uses dominate to make Nico flee
Nearly frenzies
Uses dominate to make Carlo clean up his mess
Hears a voice on the other side of the door, beast rises and Giovanna tears off the door
Snarls ‘What do you want’ at Pietro
Pietro gives Giovanna a moment to collect herself
Giovanna finally notices Andrea and blames Carlos
Giovanna heads off to cool down, Andrea looks for Carlo
Giovanna destroys a chair and Andrea hears it

#### Andrea 
Goes looking for cleaning supplies
Finds Ercole who agrees to clean it up - demands a boon after the fact

#### Carlo 
Goes looking for rags to clean with, finds a mop and bucket but no water
Who needs water?
Smears blood everywhere
Carlo can’t stop cleaning, so Andrea goes to find Giovanna so she can tell Carlo to stop
Carlo, shirtless and wearing tight ass pants, with a mop and bucket but with no water is smearing cooled cow blood all over the foyer
Giovanna tells him to stop and they all head back to their domain through the catacombs

Andrea tells Giovanna (nicely) that she should feed

#### Giovanna 
leaves the fledgelings to go hunting while they get cleaned up
Slim pickings, but find a very drunk wealthy man to feed from
She takes a little more blood than she should, leaves him on the ground in an alley
Giovanna returns once Carlo/Andrea are dressed - the clothes are ill-fitting so Giovanna begins to measure them and sends out for new clothes
Giovanna writes notes to Guidobaldo (request meeting) and Veronica (record boons)
Some discussion about how terrifying Pietro is
Giovanna runs Andrea/Carlo through the court, the positions, and levels of deference
The night ends.

There’s a ramp at one entrance to the catacombs
Make plan to get cow
Go look at where we’re going to bring the cow first
