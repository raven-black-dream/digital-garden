Head off to see the Scourge
Hand over the teeth
There are many and a Cainite tooth

Andrea used heightened senses and heard everything
Carlo goes off to Eldest Brujah’s house to spar
Andrea and Giovanna head back to the manor
Giovanna goes to make new clothes
Andrea finds Maria
	- Finds her just before she can put her mask back on
	- Horrible knowing in her eyes
	- Cannot stop crying
	- “She really made it so you can’t talk about it didn’t she?”

- Nico storms off, Carlo heads back to the manor to talk to Andrea
  
Carlo goes and knocks on the crypt door - Andrea answers, takes the note, and listens incredulously to Carlo explaining how he basically gave Nico a stroke lol

Andrea advises not upsetting Nico and that Nico probably has a system
