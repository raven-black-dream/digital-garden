### Game Start

Recap

Carlo gets a snack

Andrea gets to the rendezvous point before everyone else
- Writes a list of instructions for his new ghoul
  

Carlo arrives next - settles in to wait

Many moments later, Giovanna arrives - energetic and driven (a little high off diablerie)

Giovanna walks off, Carlo and Andrea (invisible) follow

Arrive at a room poorly lit and filled with shadow

After a moment - tendrils of shadow shoot out and capture Giovanna, but Andrea and Carlo manage to keep out of their grasp

Giovanna shoots her mouth off and the tentacles start doing damage

The Lasombra knows that Andrea is there

The Lasombra says that Cosimo is weak and should probably die

- Asks for support for their claim to the throne in exchange for Giovanna’s ghouls (or a blood oath)
- Giovanna says she is happy to support a new city
  

The Lasombra comes out of the shadows holding Piero aloft by the back of his neck - Piero is terrified

- Showing that Piero at least is still alive and says the other one is also alive
- Threat to the ghouls if Giovanna breaks their deal
- Takes Piero back into the shadows
  

Tentacles put Giovanna down, Lasombra tells them to get out

The coterie leaves

Giovanna heads to the manor

Andrea sticks a quick note under the Scourge’s door and then catches up

Giovanna pens a note about keeping everything secret and hidden, but that she needs to talk to the Scourge without the Lasombra knowing, then hands it to Andrea who reads it and passes it to Carlo who reads it and agrees


Mental note: When the Coterie returns to the manor there will be a lot of candles/other lights everywhere. (Andrea mentioned to be wary of the shadows - and Lucia is a very good submissive)


The coterie heads to Elysium - Veronica isn’t at her post

Elysium is a little subdued, but busier than it has been

  

Nico is humming in the library

He heads towards Elysium - he’s dressed in clothes from ADHD Nico and is rather uncomfortable in them

Giovanna is very surprised by his presence

He looks for the Kindred with whom he has the longest, positive, rapport - Pietro, Keeper of Elysium
- Conversation about the state of the city and what has been going on
- Mention of Leonello - Pietro’s new childer
- Discussion of Roads and Nico’s visions
  

When Nico comes out, Andrea goes to talk to him

Giovanna eventually joins and talks with Nico
- He reads her soul again and recognizes the slight change in her diablerie veins and emotions  
- He brings up Veronica being missing and Giovanna attempts to play it off as Veronica having a new toy she’s busy with
  

Giovanna heads back off to socialize

Carlo talks to some of the younger Brujah around

Giovanna eventually heads off with the coterie to see if “they can get ‘Abd out of his office”

‘Abd isn’t there, and hasn’t been there since before the Lasombra

They return to Elysium - Andrea goes to talk to Pietro, but Nico is still there

Conversation about ‘Abd being gone and ‘maybe he has secrets, everyone has secrets’ *looks at Giovanna*

Nico writes a note about Giovanna in his journal

Andrea and Pietro have a conversation in his office about the Lasombra and ‘Abd missing

When they emerge, Carlo the Herald calls out that there will be a court tomorrow at midnight, attendance is mandatory
