# Game Start

Carlo and Borso waiting in Elysium

Giovanna in the corpse-strewn house of her sire

#### Andrea 
goes to Ernst’s chapel

- Do they have somewhere to stay?
- Sends the dogs to Luca’s house
- Pixie (cat) is fine as is
- Quinn (rat) goes with Andrea
- Heads to the library

#### Giovanna
- House is quiet
- All of the life in the building has been sucked out of it
- Sire’s former seneschal lays unconscious
- Wanders through the house observing the carnage - all suicides
- Goes in search for clothes - finds her old room

- It remains unchanged
- Servants still dusted it
- Wardrobe is still full
- Finds her original debut dress - dark blue, still fits of course
  

- Momentary glimpse of the night they paid for that dress but through Cristoforo’s eyes
- Needs to get assets put into her name - goes searching for paperwork in his study
- Desk is rosewood, well-oiled, silver fittings
- Chair isn’t super comfortable
- Ledgers are open - see all his holdings
- 
- Wakes up the Seneschal
- Offers him ghouling or death
- He will handle the finances
  

- Heads out to the dead drop to find Piero
- Tells Piero about the manor and corpses
- Heads to Elysium

#### Andrea
- Enters the library
- Nico is there
- Tells him about the inquisition and that Luca/Lucia will be coming by the library
- Conversation about ghouls - wonders why Ernst hasn’t ghouled Luca/his family
- Sounds like Nico has some sort of vision - but doesn’t talk about it
- Goes looking for Ercole - but can’t find him
- Heads to Elysium

Andrea sees Giovanna at the entrance to Elysium

Discussion about what they’d both been up to in the meantime
