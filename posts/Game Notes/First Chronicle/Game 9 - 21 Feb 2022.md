Game Recap

#### Carlo and Andrea 
still in the room
Carlo heads downstairs to see if he can rent a room for the night
Giovanna is in the center of a cluster of men who are crowding her, not quite molesting her, she is passively egging them on

Innkeeper is keeping an eye on the show

Carlo asks for a room, Innkeeper eventually recognizes him and is surprised Carlo is with Giovanna

Innkeeper tells the men that Carlo tells them to get off Giovanna

Giovanna has used Dominate on one of the men to get him to throw one of the others over the bar

Large dude picks up medium dude and hurls him over the bar

A fight breaks out

Giovanna tries to get out of the middle of the fight, manages to squeak out without getting hit, saunters over to Carlo - they head upstairs

#### Andrea 
reading the journal
- Description of his interaction with Maria in the hospital
  
- Tried to tell the church, but they aren’t listening. He will probably keep trying
  
- Talks about the Hunters - no one can find the third hunter
  

#### Giovanna and Carlo enter

Andrea describes the journal entries and suggests Giovanna rewrite Brother Thomas’s memories

Giovanna has to wake him up to do that so before the other two leave Andrea asks what they should do with the notebook

Giovanna wakes up Brother Thomas with Dominate, puts on Awe to give herself an Angelic demeanour, then rewrites his memory of Maria to not include Dread Gaze and to make him think he was mugged by the hunters and they took his notebook

All three go to the room Carlo booked

Giovanna reads the notebook and recognizes Maria’s description

- Discussion about how Maria broke a rule, so Giovanna’s plan is to deliver the book to the Scourge and let him deal with it
  

Wait a bit longer in the room until it’s quieter downstairs, Andrea sneaks out behind the other two

Head to find the Scourge and deliver the book

Scourge is kneeling in meditation

Raises a hand to make them wait, then after a few moments acknowledges them

- Describe how Brother Thomas now remembers things correctly
  
- Mentions how Pietro has made some interesting comments and that he will not hesitate to take her should she become a problem
  
- Asks the others if they agree with Giovanna’s assessment
  
- Should keep an eye on Brother Thomas regardless - Giovanna offers Piero to watch him
  

Giovanna leaves Piero a note to watch over Brother Thomas while Andrea and Carlo tag along

Head back to the manor to sleep

Florence during the day

- Bustling, flourishing
  
- Talk of man-sized beasts in the streets - be careful, be wary
  

  

Andrea wakes up and goes looking for people

- No staff around
  
- Talks with Ernst

- The seneschal is missing, he gave the rest of the staff the night off
  

  

#### Carlo 
practices reading and is progressing

  

#### Giovanna 
wakes up and speaks with Piero
- Brother Thomas is a hellfire and brimstone type
- Thinks he’s a prophet of an angel
  

Giovanna finds Ernst and Andrea sitting at the fountain, relays what happened with Brother Thomas

Ernst makes a snide comment about her being civil

She apologizes, he forgives her and it rubs her the wrong way

Andrea asks if Giovanna has any plans for the evening

Giovanna mentions a conversation with eldest Brujah, then describes why she needs to have that conversation - maybe take Carlo with her

Carlo is learning to read - maybe should give him some time

Carlo emerges, Ernst takes his leave

Ernst has a glow under his shirt and it makes the Beast uncomfy

Ernst heads to the crypt

Giovanna invites Carlo to see Guidobaldo, Andrea hangs out at the manor

En route - Giovanna reiterates rules for Carlo

  

#### At [[Brujah Palazzo]]

- Bunch of Brujah toughs hanging around - security
- Giovanna goes up to the door and knocks
- Man of indeterminate age opens the door
- After introductions, man leaves. Comes back after a while and says Guidobaldo will see them
- Led into a long room full of weapons
- Short man, balding, was past his prime when he was turned; standing with a younger man and both are holding long swords in the middle of a bout
- “The prodigal idiot returns, with his Ventrue caretaker”  
- Discussion of the book and Alessandra
  

- Side convo (canon, but from another time) - Carlo thinks Giovanna should learn how to defend herself, she insists she can, he suggests that he’ll hire some humans to attack her and see if she can defend herself.
  

- Guidobaldo offers the book or info if they can entertain him
- Carlo offers to spar, Guido accepts
- It’s a whirlwind event - Guido wins
- Guido admits that Carlo may not be entirely useless and describes the circumstances of his turning
- The book is on a table UTTERLY DESTROYED (Jen’s opinion) - food crumbs, stains, etc. on virgin vellum.
- Giovanna leaves Carlo there with Guidobaldo
  

  

Meanwhile - Andrea is investigating the dagger
- Pretty dagger
- Unsheathes it - very sharp
- Used recently - multiple different kinds of blood - not quite dry
- Almost gets drawn in to the blood - almost licks it, but doesn’t; very hungry
- Puts the dagger away so as to not be tempted
