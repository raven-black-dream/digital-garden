### Game Start

Recap

The fire at the church was eventually put out, many piles of ashes

Night falls. Rooms had been chosen previously - Andrea picks something small and out of the way, Carlo picks a room at random, Giovanna chooses a guest room

When Giovanna wakes up, Piero isn’t there to meet her for the first time in forever. 

The seneschal isn’t there either

Giovanna leaves a note for Piero to find her

When Andrea wakes up - Quinn has found him. There’s a note from the Scourge saying thank you

Borso is dozing in a nearby chair when Carlo wakes up

Carlo gently nudges Borso awake - Borso starts awake suddenly and goes for his sword before realizing it’s Carlo

Borso says the clean up was rough - had to set the church on fire

Carlo tells Borso to take the bed

Andrea sees if Quinn has any more info before going to see if the others know about how the cleanup went

Carlo goes to tell the others about the cleanup

Giovanna heads out to check the dead drop she uses with Piero then goes to see the Scourge

Carlo went to find food

Andrea heads to the library

Nico is there, but not Lucia or Luca

Nico seems to be missing some days

Andrea runs into Luca and Lucia as they come through the door

Luca isn’t expecting it and runs in fear

Lucia waits there - she’s wearing a pretty daring dress

Andrea mentions the new place

Since Luca’s fully fled, Andrea takes Lucia to the new house

They go through the catacombs, Lucia holds on close to Andrea

All is quiet in the manor when they return

Andrea is hungry

Lucia lets her shawl slip to show her neck - comments that Andrea looks hungry

Andrea goes to feed, tries to take one

Lucia holds Andrea to her in an ecstatic state, he takes 2

Andrea pries her arms off of him and pushes her away, he’s taken another one

She’s breathing very shallow, on the edge of consciousness

Andrea tries to give Lucia back some blood, bites his lip or tongue to get some blood

Kisses Lucia, she grips Andrea just as hard as before

Andrea heals an agg and gets hungrier

Andrea goes to the library to check it out, Lucia follows

Carlo goes looking for food

He finds it - drinks the guy dry, the woman screams

He kills the woman

Opts to hide their corpses on the roof

Carlo heads to Elysium to see if there’s a party or people to talk to

Giovanna heads to the dead drop - it’s empty

She heads towards Elysium to talk to ‘Abd

See Luca just booking it - screaming

No one is around so Giovanna just lets him go

~Insert ‘Abd conversation here~

Andrea is investigating the library and keeping an eye on Lucia, but is not happy with her

Andrea sends Lucia to look for Luca

Giovanna and Carlo run into each other and head to Elysium

Veronica is outside Elysium being her usual catty self

Giovanna bites back, and dominates her to give all the recent news

- Mortals managed to put out the fire at the church
  
- People who assisted are all fine
  
- Lasombra from Milan are expected to make a big splash in court in a couple days
  

- Planning to bring down the prince
  

Giovanna uses Forgetful Mind to make Veronica think she spilled the info on her own

Carlo and Giovanna head in, Giovanna tells Carlo not to spill about Veronica’s news, she wants to tell the Scourge

Seemingly everyone has shown up to Elysium, except the prince who is still awol

Giovanna mingles for a bit, then leaves to go to ‘Abd’s office

Andrea spots Giovanna leaving Elysium and heading to the Scourge

He hurries to meet up with her and asks if she has news, she says that she’s on her way to give ‘Abd some news and he should come with

They head into ‘Abd’s office and Giovanna spills the news

Discussion on Lasombra and Inquisition

‘Abd has things to prepare for alone, but we should tell Pietro quietly

Head back to Elysium - find Carlo on the dance floor

He spots Giovanna and Andrea and comes over to talk with Pietro with them

Get Pietro’s attention and ask to talk - he says to give him a minute and he’ll let them into his office

They wait and then enter Pietro’s office

Carlo hears very very faint sobbing

Tell Pietro about the news

Asks if anyone else knows

Carlo is seeing if he can pinpoint the crying - asks Pietro outright

Are you sure you want to know?

Carlo asks how Leonello’s doing

He’s strong enough to make it, but he changing and it’s hard

The coterie leaves

Giovanna mentions Piero is awol

Andrea hasn’t seen him or the seneschal

The coterie heads back to the manor

Lucia has gathered the old manor staff (service sub gonna service sub)

Luca looks alright, but a little embarrassed

Andrea mentions that the space is Giovanna’s now and that the manor staff are welcome to stay

Luca decides to not ask Giovanna what happened to the old staff

He also hasn’t seen Piero or the seneschal

The coterie goes to speak to Borso

Borso doesn’t know where they went - they were supposed to come back to the manor

Giovanna goes out to feed - heads to the merchant quarter also looking for Piero

Finds a dyer’s shop - the one Piero works/studies at - with a candle still lit

Sees a master dyer through the window

Tries to sneak in through an unlocked door - sets off the door jingle

Man jumps and goes for his dagger, manages to clear it but Giovanna catches his eyes and Commands him to stop

She feeds from him and then leaves

Heads back to the manor

Giovanna heads into the library where Andrea and Luca were talking

Tucked in Giovanna’s belt (she hasn’t noticed) is a little note tied with the blackest ribbon he’s ever seen

Note: We have them
