### Game Start

Recap

Strangely coordinated pack of dogs running through the city

Giovanna wakes up - heals and get hungrier
- Beast sounding like her sire
- Piero isn’t there
- Goes looking for food
- No one’s on the street so she falls back into old habits and heads back to the artisan’s district, thinking of Piero
- Follows a banker and feeds deep from him (Giovanna is thinking about eating Veronica)

- Realizes she’s in the middle of a square
- Completely misses the three humans that were (several minutes ago) running terrified from the square as a person was eaten.

- Walks away and returns to the manor in time for the end of Andrea’s conversation with Luca
  

Andrea - after convo with Luca
- Sees Giovanna as she comes in
- Looking for the dogs
- Cerberus is waiting outside
- Kept finding scents but they ended at walls


Giovanna goes looking for Veronica

Carlo wakes up - Borso is there and clearly uncomfortable

- Story of how he almost staked Giovanna
- He’s very confused about how he moved so fast
- The two spar and get Borso to practice Celerity
  

Andrea ducks back into the manor and relays info to Carlo and Lucia

Carlo decides to join Giovanna - still has Celerity so surprises her on approach

Head on to Veronica


Nico Time

- Wakes up
- A lot of shadow detail
- Scent of frankincense and myrrh
- Feeling that things in Florence are changing
- Checks his book of hours - several blank days, notes about the Prince acting weird and the Inquisition
- Library is silent - Ercole and Maria don’t seem to be around
- After some pondering in the silence - hears Giovanna and Carlo walking past (talking about Borso)
- Hurries to the door
- Giovanna looks different
- Nico decides to read her soul
	- Realizes she’s a diablerist
  
- Stops them to inquire about the quiet library
- Ercole is probably with the other cowards hiding in the Tremere chantry
- Inquires about the Inquisition and the shadows
- Giovanna mentions the Lasombra and says Ercole hasn’t been around for about a week (it’s been 3 days max)
- Nico goes to take stock of the sorry state of his library

Giovanna heading to talk to Veronica - Carlo following
- Sometime later it will occur to Giovanna that Malkavians have Auspex

Veronica is not at Elysium, but Carlo knows where she lives

Giovanna knocks and puts on Awe - flirty and friendly
- Giovanna just socially demolishes Veronica
- Much flirting
- Giovanna asks about the ghouls
- Veronica gives a location
- Giovanna plants a command in Veronica’s mind to meet later
- Asks if there’s a powder room - uses Forgetful Mind to alter the previous scene and send Veronica back to Carlo’s arms
- Carlo acquiesces - “Fuck it.”
- Giovanna bails
  
Andrea

- Goes to eat cows
- Heals
- Eats more cows
- Goes to find Ernst in his chapel
- Ernst isn’t the same - no clack of rosary beads, instead the sound of a stone sharpening a blade of some sort
- Ernst was at the Inquisition fight
- Was stealthy before the embrace, so that’s why the Inquisition didn’t see him when they saw Andrea
  

- He’s cleaning his family’s weapon - there’s a rot that needs expunging
- The rot goes to the very core of the church
- Ernst has his new mission - God has shown him his path and granted him strength and tools to take that which has been corrupted out of the church
- Ernst was lost, but has found his way now
- Will take his crusade to the Vatican
- Will be the personification of God’s righteous anger on Earth
- Are you planning to fight all of the Lasombra as well? - The magister will see sense
- Andrea asks about the manor or the staff
- Ernst gives Andrea the manor and whatever the staff want
- Ernst walks out - sword in left hand
- Tells Andrea - you may not walk the path of Christ, but strive not to give in to the beast you were made into and I will be proud of you
- Fades from view
- Andrea heads back to the manor

Giovanna went back to the manor - figuring out her wardrobe - doesn’t notice when Andrea returns

Andrea informs Lucia of Ernst’s crusade - she retrieves Luca while Andrea heads to the library

Luca asks to drop the formalities

Once Andrea agrees, Luca asks to be a ghoul
- He wants the protection that being a ghoul would give him
- Other Kindred know he knows too much
- Andrea tries to warn him off, but gives him a vial of blood that Luca drinks
- Luca leaves to gather the staff
  
Giovanna notices Luca gathering the staff

Finds Andrea sitting in the library - contemplating

Giovanna tells Andrea the location of the Lasombra and that she didn’t want to rush in, so wants to wait for Carlo in order to make a plan

Carlo enters

Discussion of the plan to talk to the Lasombra

Andrea asks if we should tell the Scourge

Giovanna chooses to write a note, Andrea suggests talking to him

Giovanna and Carlo need to feed, Andrea goes to talk to the Scourge

The plan is to go meet near the Lasombra, then go talk to them before it gets too late

Andrea tells the Scourge everything matter-of-factly

‘Abd SIGHS - That girl is going to get me killed

Quick lesson on Lasombra

Isn’t sure what they want from Giovanna


Giovanna goes to meet Veronica

Diablerizes her after a fight
