### Game Start

After announcement - Pietro heads back to his office, the rest of us have small reactions

Return to the manor after some time - remarkably well lit - Lucia is a good submissive

It’s approaching dawn - the Cainites sleep

Florence during the day

- Recovering
  
- Church is being repaired
  
- Market is busy
  

  

Sunset

Giovanna wakes

- Piero isn’t there of course
  
- She’s resigned to his death
  
- Heals - gets hungrier
  

  

Andrea wakes

- Senses a presence
  
- Luca is there
  

  

Carlo wakes

- Borso is waiting, tending his sword
  
- The staff is very efficient, but also….very efficient
  
- Talk of Leonello - he’s always been strong
  
- We said we’d follow you into hell, didn’t expect it to be literal
  
- Makes sure his sword is tended to be prepared for court
  

  

Andrea and Carlo hear a bloodcurdling scream from outside

Both head outside - scream is continuous and coming towards them

Carlo activates Celerity and runs towards the scream

Middle class female running pell mell towards them

Vaguely human like shape loping like a predator towards the woman

Carlo steps in front of the woman and tries to direct her down a side street to safety

She gets startled and runs head first into a wall

The predator gathers himself and leaps 12 feet in the air and towards the woman

Andrea catches up - realizes it’s Piero

No one’s coming out - just looking out through curtains

Carlo tries to grab the woman and drag her down an alley

Drops the woman without coming to a complete stop - woman gets thrown 30 ft and lands in an awkward heap with several snaps

Andrea tries to get a reaction from Piero - calls his name

Piero turns sharply and sprints at Andrea

Andrea tries Song of Serenity - it doesn’t work

Carlo goes to check that the woman is breathing, then tries to get Piero’s attention away from Andrea

Andrea gets out of the way enough that Piero misses and hits the ground hard

  

Giovanna finally hears the scream - it gets cut short - a door was left open and Giovanna goes looking

Hears Andrea shout Piero’s name, but is confused by it. Picks up her pace a little

Sees Piero leap at Andrea and crash into the ground, looks at his hands in confusion

Giovanna stops dead and stares

Catches Piero’s eyes - sees terror for a moment before the hunger reasserts itself

Piero turns to seek out Andrea

Carlo does something stupid

- Calls Piero’s name
  

Piero ignores Carlo - gouges his nails down Andrea’s face

Giovanna screams Piero’s name

Carlo sprints up, grabs Piero from behind and drags him down the alley

Andrea and Giovanna run after them

Andrea is still confused

Carlo thinks Piero’s in frenzy, Giovanna turns the corner and explains that it’s not frenzy

Giovanna is heartbroken, suggests staking him

She tries, but fails miserably, asks Carlo to help

Carlo successfully stakes Piero and he goes limp

Carlo takes Piero’s body up to a rooftop hideaway to let him wait for the sun

Giovanna heads back to the manor

Andrea notices the woman in a heap - broken but breathing

Carlo comes back - “It’s the cow all over again. I moved too fast”

Andrea asks Carlo to go find Luca and get someone who knows medicine

Carlo catches up with Giovanna, but Giovanna is pretty non-responsive

  

Nico

- Has a vision
  
- Hears Latin
  

- ‘Abd says I’m sorry
  
- Andrea’s face is shocked
  

Nico enters main library area to find Carlo the Herald

Mandatory court - Nico is “thrilled”

Carlo turns into an owl and flies out a window

The window is broken and Ercole is still missing

Gets prepped in court clothes

Stews on the vision

Takes a trip through the catacombs to try and intersect with the coterie


Giovanna and Carlo continue back to the manor

Giovanna goes into the library and slams the door

Luca comes out and Carlo happens to recognize him

Sends Luca to help Andrea

Luca says the woman would be better off dead

Andrea feeds off the woman and kills her
  

Heading to court

- Nico shows up approaching at a very odd angle
  
- Discussion of his library and ghouls
  
- Head into Elysium and grab a seat
  

Nico sees that most people he’d expect to see in court are there - can’t really see his assistant - group of 5 cloaked in shadows in the back


Andrea: What did you see?

Nico: Shadows


All rise for Prince Cosimo with Pietro and ‘Abd dressed as per their stations

  
Visitors to speak - Lasombra
  

Traitors and diablerists
  

Francesco (Andrea’s ex-lord) is with the Lasombra - introduces the Abyssal mystic - Paolo Genovese


Asks if the Prince is going to step down now


Suddenly movement behind the throne

Long strip of Tyrian purple fabric

Resounding, resonant voice - everyone hits their knees and bows, even Cosimo

Pressure eases so we can all watch Marcus holding Prince Cosimo up like it’s by the scruff of his neck

- ANGERY
  
- Cosimo has ruined HIS city
  

Prince Marcus of Florence rips Cosimo’s head clean off and throws the corpse into the aisle and it slowly turns to dust - continues to hold Cosimo’s head by a small amount of hair


Tells the Lasombra to leave - throws Cosimo’s head at them
  

Diablerie in the city - demands the culprit(s) come forward


Giovanna’s feet carry her to the dais

She confesses to her two diableries

Says they were unworthy of their blood, but she accepts his discipline

Marcus realizes ‘Abd was teaching her

‘Abd says he’ll take care of it

Giovanna doesn’t resist as ‘Abd grabs her hair and drains her of blood

‘Abd does 8 unspeakable agg and takes the Debitum/calcified heart - holds it up to Marcus

“It is as it should be”
  
Court is dismissed

“Is Nico going to say something to Marcus?”

“Oh no, not today!”


Andrea is watching Francesco who returns to the Lasombra

Carlo tries to keep Andrea from doing dumb things

Andrea wants to ask about the seneschal (Giulio)

Carlo bodily hauls Andrea away and they return to the manor

Andrea is agitated about the Lasombra and losing his chance to talk to them

Carlo suggests talking to Pietro - Andrea needs to leave RIGHT NOW

Andrea tries to lose Carlo in the catacombs, but can’t - just go on a merry goose chase

Andrea heads past where the Lasombra used to be

Two individuals cloaked in shadows

Andrea asks who is there - one is Paolo (Abyssal mystic)

Andrea demands to know where the seneschal ghoul is

Safe and sound, after a fashion

Andrea asks him to leave the ghoul with the coterie

Paolo asks what he’s worth to Andrea

Paolo asks Andrea to serve the Lasombra in the city as Veronica did
