## Banishment - Level 4
While in many cases Abyssal entities called forth by Mystics are simply destroyed by the following sunrise, there may be cases where a Mystic is unable to destroy either the entity or the practitioner and needs to banish the creature back to the Abyss.

System: The caster must first gain control of the Abyssal entity. If it is one created by the caster, or otherwise does not have a current master, the Mystic rolls Intelligence + Occult, difficulty 9. If the entity has been summoned by a Mystic who is still controlling it, the roll is contested and both Mystics will add their Obtenebration rating to the roll.

Once control is gained, the Mystic must maintain control while performing the ritual. There may be subsequent Int+Occult (+Obten) rolls at the Storytellerâ€™s discretion.

The Mystic then spends one hour and one to three points of her own blood (depending on size) painting a circle of containment around the entity.

Once the ritual is complete, the Mystic rolls a final Int+Occult roll to force the creature to return to the Abyss.

The Mystic may set up the containment circle in advance with an increase in difficulty including a potential threshold for successes needed.

#### Consequences

The consequences for this ritual may be adjusted based on circumstances.

While attempting to gain control of the entity:
- When 0-3 successes have been achieved, a subsequent botch means the entity simply leaves
- When 4-6 successes have been achieved, a subsequent botch means that the entity takes 3 points of blood (auto-failed rouse checks)
- When 7-8 successes have been achieved, a subsequent botch means that the entity takes 5 points of blood (5 auto-failed rouse checks and an immediate hunger frenzy)
- If the control part of the ritual takes longer than 3 rounds, it becomes increasingly more likely that a mortal will stumble upon the ritual (assuming that the ritual is being performed in the open)

When attempting to banish the entity:
- When 0-3 successes have been achieved, a subsequent botch means starting over and having to regain control
- When 4-6 successes have been achieved, a subsequent botch means damage to health and temporary damage to willpower
- When 7-8 successes have been achieved, a subsequent botch means an Abyssal explosion with Aggravated damage for anyone nearby and a Masquerade violation
- If the banishment part of the ritual takes longer than one round, each subsequent round gives temporary willpower damage and it becomes increasingly more likely that a mortal will stumble upon the ritual

If it becomes obvious that releasing the ritual is the better option, the Mystic will roll one additional Int+Occult roll. If that roll is a success based on the standard difficulty/threshold for this ritual, the ritual may be undone safely. If the roll fails, that results in a botch effect at the level previously obtained (i.e. if 3 successes had previously been achieved before this attempt, the effect would be a botch at the 0-3 successes level). If the roll results in a botch, the effect will be a botch at the level above what was previously obatained (i.e. if 3 successes had previously been achieved before this attempt, the effect would be a botch at the 4-6 successes level).

There may be additional narrative consequences depending on the situation.
