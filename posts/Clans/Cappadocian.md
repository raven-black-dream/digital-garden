# Cappadocian
Primogen:  [[Brother Antonio]]

## Current State of Affairs
- [x] #todo Fill out clan document

## Plans
They are not currently planning anything. They are mostly trying to keep themselves alive and in a good position in the City.

## Stance on Marcus
For the most part the Clan Cappadocian in Florence is neutral to Marcus. They are mostly just trying to stay 'alive'. Currently the clan is responsible for Elysium. They view the city through the lens of it being a place that is relatively safe from the Giovanni.
