# Nosferatu
Primogen: [[Pietro]]

## Current State of Affairs
- [x] #todo Fill out clan document

## Plans
Hiding and secretive
Information brokers
Secret keepers
Andrea being used as a go-between for the clan members and Pietro
Maybe a plot where they're being threatened [[The Hungry Shade]]?
Young Nos thinks he has dirt on the Prince - lolz ensue
    - Pietro sends Andrea to dissuade the Nos from this course of action
    - Only works if Andrea is the conduit for Pietro
    - Maybe a smaller hook into a bigger plot point
- Potentially pissed at the Brujah (Carlo specifically) en masse if Borso keeps bothering them in their warrens

## Stance on Marcus

Neutral-positive
They have more power than Nos anywhere else
Cosimo shit all over them so...
