# Gangrel
Primogen: [[Carlo(Herald)]]

## Current State of Affairs
- [ ] #todo Fill out clan document

Most Gangrel associated with Florence are outside the city as hunters/farmers

Marcus lets then be, but if he calls Elysium/court they BEST show up in order to keep his protection

Most Gangrel in/around the City are minding their own business. Many of them are Lupine Hunters. These Gangrel tend to group together in packs. 

## Plans

Carlo would like to get out from under Marcus's thumb. He doesn't like being the Herald of the city at all and would prefer to be out in the world.

## Stance on Marcus

Most of the Gangrel in the city are pretty neutral towards Marcus. There is a percentage of the Gangrel which are pissed that Marcus allowed the incompetance of Cosimo to rule the city.
