# Malkavian
Primogen: [[Filin da Quieto d'Arzenta]]

## Current State of Affairs
- [ ] #todo Fill out clan document

Small clan
Important clan
Marcus respects them as Seers - take what they say with a grain of salt, but pay attention
- some are crazy in ways that are productive, some are crazy in ways that are not

## Plans
Filin is angling to displace Marcus. (This is very unlikely, but Filin thinks that Marcus is a little too insane to continue to rule with any real success.)

## Stance on Marcus

The Malkavians do not have any particularly strong feelings toward/about Marcus
