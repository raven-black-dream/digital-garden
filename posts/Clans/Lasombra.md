# Lasombra
## Current State of Affairs
- [ ] #todo Fill out clan document


## Plans
#### Within Florence
Only [[Salamah bint Alzilal]] is within the city
	- Current Goals
		- Stay alive/undead
		- Prove herself useful - find her place in the city
		- Build a shadow oubliette
		- Continue studying the Abyss
			- Seeking Lasombra
			- Attempting to map the Abyss
			- Wants to develop new Abyss Mysticism Rituals
			- Wants to understand the source of the Abyss

#### Milan
- [[Paolo]] is using [[Francesco Sforza]] to spy on Florence
- [[Paolo]] is using [[Piero Rosso]] by pointing the mindless murderous tendencies at Paulo's enemies and problems
	- Mostly in Milan to start, then occasionally branching out
- Aspirations put on hold due to French and Venetian military alliane against Milan (captured 1499 - likely no Cainite involvement, so it's more about making sure they quickly find ways to reassert control in the city)

#### Elsewhere
The Catholic Church
	- Michaelangelo under the patronage of the pope
		- Ends up getting ordered around to different projects depending on the pope
		- St. Peter's Basilica
	- True Faith?

## Stance on Marcus
Salamah has no opinion on Marcus save that he has allowed her to remain in the city - seemingly begrudgingly.

Potential: Marcus has a long-standing feud with the Lasombra, stemming from the Roman age.

Why did the Lasombra target Florence?

When did Marcus leave Rome? Did he abandon the city when it needed him?
- Sack of Rome 476 - Lasombra stayed to rebuild with the Emperor Flavius
- Does Marcus have an enemy in the Lasombra?
- If this is all true, why would Marcus allow Salamah to stay? - 'abd asked, and potentially Salamah has/had intel on the Milanese Lasombra
	- What intel?
