# The Warrens

The warrens are the conglomerated Haven of the majority of Clan Nosferatu. It has a central communal area with several satellite Havens. 

It is clearly a place where very different people live basically on top of eachother. Some of the Nosferatu are slobs, others are pretty fastidious. 

There are conflicting styles which are fighting for predominance in the main area. There are a few different sections which are twisted and multileveled and a bit of a maze for anyone who isn't accustomed to it. After significant amounts of time the logic of the place sinks in and makes it easier to navigate.

Each of the havens are much more personalized. But, they appear to be owned by relatively few Nosferatu. The Nosferatu that own the havens are a mix between the clan Elite, and cainites that are willing to take the space from someone else.
