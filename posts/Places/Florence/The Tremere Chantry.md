title: "The Tremere Chantry"
---

Chantry protections
- Bigger on the inside (lower levels)
- Sigil traps
- Wards
- Mortal mage magic
	- Enchantment to keep people lost/going around in circles
	- Wards against life or against matter (undead) - bunch of dead rats, life wars
	- Time speeds up or slows down in certain areas
	- Spirits are harnessed into work (could be ghosts, could be spirits of knowledge etc. May attacked if released - think Dresden)
	- A trap in some books that makes the reader unable to stop reading
	- Maybe fire traps since Tremere can do fire with their blood magic
	- When you cross a threshold you decide you'd rather turn around and go back
- Fratellino absorbing a spirit of knowledge
