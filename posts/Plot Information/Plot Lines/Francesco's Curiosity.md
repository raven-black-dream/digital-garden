## Setup

What could that Nosferatu have meant? "Give my fond regards to Francesco" what Nosferatu could possibly have fond regards for him? Francesco scoffs to himself. Maybe it is worth exploring. Anything really to get out of this place. Hours and Hours of sitting meditating on the cold of the abyss. 

Why is it so important to Paolo? Why must he feel the creeping darkness? Why must he linger on the thoughts of that lonely cold, the darkness beyond all love? The empty void?

At least he hasn't been thrown into that Oubliette recently. Francesco shivers remembering the dead eyes of Paolo's pet, and the ramblings of the ghoul kept there. 

Why has Paolo left him there? What sense does that make? 

Francesco turns his mind back to the Nosferatu. Giovanna's lacky Paolo had said. 

Days Later:

The abyss was worse than usual. But at least he was gifted that abyssal spy. Watching Florence from afar will have to suffice until he can gain enough of Paolo's trust to be able to go there and observe by himself.

Many Years Pass:

A shadowy figure in the catacombs calls out to Lucia. "Fond Greetings Lucia, could you please pass this and my best regards to Andrea? I am an old friend, longing to reconnect."

His teeth gleam in the barest light of the corridor. "Thank you, for your assistance"

## Notes
- Francesco pops in and out of Florence every so often to spy
- Uses Lucia to get to Andrea?
- Paolo wants Francesco to prove he's a real Lasombra (Obten 3)

## The Letter

"
Andrea, 

It took me far too long to figure out what might be the reason that a Nosferatu that I had never encountered would send "Fond Regards" through my Sire. It took many more years for me to make the connection to you. 

I thought that you, like all of the men that followed me to that accursed battlefield, had died. Carlo du Vido's men described in vivid detail the thorough approach they took to giving the suffering mercy. I thought that I would never see or hear from you again. It broke me to learn of your death.

When Paolo paid my ransom on behalf of my family, and said that my family had traded my soul for the money to pay for my release, I gave in.

Many years later I learned that you too were embraced into this world of darkness, this realm of shadows and intrigue. It saddens me to see that you were embraced by the Lepers. I hope that you aren't treated too badly by Marcus and his lackies. It is a shame that your city is ruled by a Ventrue. They are so heavy handed, they lack the political graces to lead by example. I hope that someday you can be freed of the Tyrant.

I hope that you don't mind my sending this message through your Ghoul Attache, it seemed the best way to get it into your hands with the least amount of fuss. 

Maria would likely have tried to read the note without conditioning, and Luca wouldn't have accepted it without a fair bit of questioning, I think. 

Warmest Regards, 
Francesco

## Andrea's Response
"
I am so glad you heard my fond regards. 

I saw you at Court for the first time since the battlefield, and did not think I could get around your company to say hello, but I did try. The loss of all the household was indeed a heartbreak. I had hoped we had bought you enough time to escape but learnt that was not the case. 

I should have died on that field but was found somehow still partially alive. I had some unfortunate forced relations at the start of my time as a Cainite, but as you have obviously found now, I do happily have my own small household to lead. 

I am happy to hear from you and passing a note for me is good, though I would warn you not to harm any of my ghouls. As you would have protected your household in life, it is my duty to protect them now. 

Given history, Florence could be dangerous for you to be in without permission, though the city is really not as bad as you think. Perhaps one day we could meet again on a more positive note. How best may one contact you?
"

## Francesco's Response

"
Yes, the man whose company I often find myself in is not the most reasonable cainite to be around. I appreciate your attempt to "say hello", though it is probably a better idea to not deal with him too closely. 

I am glad to see that you have moved in the direction that I was hoping and expecting that you would. I always felt that you were capable of far more than your service to me ever allowed you. I will keep your duty to protect your household in mind in future encounters with them. I would hate for us to come to blows over the treatment of a few mortals.

I am glad to hear that you are not treated poorly in that city. Though I am not sure that you are aware of the entirety of the history of Florence? The city used to be quite friendly to Lasombra. 

As for how to contact me, please seal any reply with the signet ring that I included with this note. Then leave it just inside the Shadow Gate in Florence. I will receive it. 

Thank you for your interest in continued correspondance. There is a shocking dearth of pleasant conversationalists here in Milan. I look forward to our future interactions. 

Perhaps in the future our paths may cross in a way that is more positive, though I think that that may be challenging given the current tensions between our cities.

Best Regards,
{{Signet Ring Impression Here}}

### Andrea Letter #2
Draft 1
1 - Yes, my interactions with that particular individual have not been ideal. I agree that it is best not to deal with him too closely. {Yeah no duh I don't want to deal with him at all nevermind too closely. It might be best if you didn't either, but Imma say that in a way that could be read as just talking about myself.} 
 
2 - {Some version of AAAAaaaaawwwww thank you, but with a gracious time-period-appropriate flourish. Then talking about said new household.} You may find you like these mortals if you came to know them. The one whom you have delivered correspondence to is efficient, diligent, and has adapted remarkably well to straddling the mortal and cainite worlds. The other two are also incredibly adept that the tasks they undertake, and surrounding oneself with knowledgable and dedicated people - mortal or cainite - is helpful. {In character, he's trying to humanize and contextualize his ghouls so that they aren't _just_ "a few mortals". Out of character, I'm doing this to potentially set up a positive view on Lucia the way you lay out his opinion of Andrea in the last letter, should you choose to go on that route later. He's also avoiding using names outright or specifying details like "the one that works in the library" throughout the letter.)

3 - I am sure the histories and stories we have both been 'brought up on' so to speak in our respective cities, each have their own biases and gaps. To claim to know the entirety of a whole city's thousands of years of history while having been there for forty years would be quite a feat, though I have made a point of learning what I can in my time. {He's opening the door for Francesco to say more here, without trying to claim that he knows all the things, or fully admitting to not knowing what Francesco is getting at.} 

4 - Thank you for the signet ring. (Insert either reminiscing about the old ring, or comments on the new design here.) How secure is the Shadow Gate? {He's discretely trying to fish for information generally about the shadow, who uses it and how it works, partially for the confidentiality of correspondence, partially cause... yeah...} You seem to have no problems delivering correspondence to my attache, so I at least have few worries about the return route. 

5 - (Insert some reminiscing on details of conversation from their mortal time together.) 

6 - The two areas definitely do not get along. It would certainly not do for you to be found in this city, and while I am happy to attend to business on the outskirts of the city's surrounds, I have no intention of visiting your city. Circumstances are always changing but you are quite right that the two systems and cities are not compatible now. {Something to the effect of 'Quite. This whole thing is made of problems. But, you never know.} 

Best regards, A {note isn't addressed by name, nor signed with more than a letter and a ring imprint}

Finished letter:

"It is good to hear from you again.

Yes, my interactions with that particular individual have not been ideal. I agree that it is best not to deal with him too closely.

You flatter me with your compliments. You and the rest of the household were good to work with, and I did take great pride in my work as a mortal. You may also find you like these mortals if you came to know them. The one to whom you have delivered correspondence to is efficient, diligent, and has adapted remarkably well to straddling the mortal and cainite worlds. The other two are also incredibly adept that the tasks they undertake, and surrounding oneself with knowledgable and dedicated people - mortal or cainite - is helpful.

I am sure the histories and stories we have both been 'brought up on' so to speak in our respective cities, each have their own biases and gaps. To claim to know the entirety of a whole city's thousands of years of history while having been there for forty years would be quite a feat, though I have made a point of learning what I can in my time.

Thank you for the signet ring, it is of great sentimental value to have one of my old items back. (Insert reminiscing about the old ring.) How secure is the Shadow Gate? You seem to have no problems delivering correspondence to my attache, so I at least have few worries about the return route.

(Insert some reminiscing on details of conversation from their mortal time together.)

The two areas definitely do not get along. It would certainly not do for you to be found within the walls of this city, and I likewise have no intention of visiting your city myself. Circumstances are always changing but you are quite right that the two places are not compatible now.

Best regards, A"
