## Setup

What could that Nosferatu have meant? "Give my fond regards to Francesco" what Nosferatu could possibly have fond regards for him? Francesco scoffs to himself. Maybe it is worth exploring. Anything really to get out of this place. Hours and Hours of sitting meditating on the cold of the abyss. 

Why is it so important to Paolo? Why must he feel the creeping darkness? Why must he linger on the thoughts of that lonely cold, the darkness beyond all love? The empty void?

At least he hasn't been thrown into that Oubliette recently. Francesco shivers remembering the dead eyes of Paolo's pet, and the ramblings of the ghoul kept there. 

Why has Paolo left him there? What sense does that make? 

Francesco turns his mind back to the Nosferatu. Giovanna's lacky Paolo had said. 

Days Later:

The abyss was worse than usual. But at least he was gifted that abyssal spy. Watching Florence from afar will have to suffice until he can gain enough of Paolo's trust to be able to go there and observe by himself.

Many Years Pass:

A shadowy figure in the catacombs calls out to Lucia. "Fond Greetings Lucia, could you please pass this and my best regards to Andrea? I am an old friend, longing to reconnect."

His teeth gleam in the barest light of the corridor. "Thank you, for your assistance"

## Notes
- Francesco pops in and out of Florence every so often to spy
- Uses Lucia to get to Andrea?
- Paolo wants Francesco to prove he's a real Lasombra (Obten 3)

## The Letter

"
Andrea, 

It took me far too long to figure out what might be the reason that a Nosferatu that I had never encountered would send "Fond Regards" through my Sire. It took many more years for me to make the connection to you. 

I thought that you, like all of the men that followed me to that accursed battlefield, had died. Carlo du Vido's men described in vivid detail the thorough approach they took to giving the suffering mercy. I thought that I would never see or hear from you again. It broke me to learn of your death.

When Paolo paid my ransom on behalf of my family, and said that my family had traded my soul for the money to pay for my release, I gave in.

Many years later I learned that you too were embraced into this world of darkness, this realm of shadows and intrigue. It saddens me to see that you were embraced by the Lepers. I hope that you aren't treated too badly by Marcus and his lackies. It is a shame that your city is ruled by a Ventrue. They are so heavy handed, they lack the political graces to lead by example. I hope that someday you can be freed of the Tyrant.

I hope that you don't mind my sending this message through your Ghoul Attache, it seemed the best way to get it into your hands with the least amount of fuss. 

Maria would likely have tried to read the note without conditioning, and Luca wouldn't have accepted it without a fair bit of questioning, I think. 

Warmest Regards, 
Francesco
