# The Ritual Dagger

## Primary Character Focus
- [[Andrea Vasari]]
- [[Fratellino]]

## Main Goal
Something to do with the Ritual Dagger that Fratellino acquired for Andrea

## Steps to Achieve
 - Ordered list of steps to complete the main goal
 
## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup

Andrea has been able to find that the knife is an athame (ritual knife), and that it was a focus for one of the Tremere. But he doesn't know the specifics of the ability - other than that blood that is spilled on it stays fresh almost indefinitely in the sheathe.

The dagger makes certain spells easier. (thaumaturgy, or other blood sorcery)
