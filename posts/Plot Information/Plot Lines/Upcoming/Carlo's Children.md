# Carlo's Children

## Primary Character Focus
- [[Carlo du Vido]]

### Notes
Carlo may know about one of the chlidren. Possibly married the mother off to one of his men to take care of the situation. A few other ideas may be fun.

## Main Goal
Text goes here

## Steps to Achieve
 - Ordered list of steps to complete the main goal

## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup
Text describing the beginning of the arc.
