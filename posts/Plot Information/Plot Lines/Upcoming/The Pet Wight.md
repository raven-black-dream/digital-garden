## Setup

The shadows cling to the figure in the centre of the room. They reach out to him caressing him like a lover. They whisper to him of the great and terrible things that he will achieve. Already, his plans are coalescing his disappointment of a childe is showing some worth at last. Insinuating himself into the life of that Nosferatu slug. 

Paulo sneers his disgust at the memory of that gutter rat refusing the hand up he'd been offered. Playing at having the Moral High Ground. How little he knows of the way this world works. The sway of the human heart will wear away. It always does.

Paulo shakes his head. Clearing away the momentary diversion from his plans. He will not be surprised by one such as Marcus again. The Throne of Florence might be out of his immediate reach, but chaos can still reign in the streets. 

"I wonder if it is time to send out my pet again. The city could use a little excitement. Besides, Francesco hasn't had enough incentive of late to embrace the Shadows."

Paulo reaches out to the stroking arms of shadow, to the waiting cold of the Abyss, and steps smoothly into the Oubliette. There stands, staked in torpor, the former ghoul of that Insufferable Failure of a Ventrue. Paulo feels a frisson pass through his dead flesh as his fingers glide over the stake. Yes, some night soon Florence will feel the rending claws of the Sabbat.

## Notes
- Potentially send to Florence
- Possibly linked either to [[Francesco's Curiosity]]
