# Leonello's Resentment

## Primary Character Focus
- [[Carlo du Vido]]
- [[Leonello]]
- [[Borso]]

## Main Goal
Help [[Carlo du Vido]] regain [[Leonello]]'s Love and Trust

## Steps to Achieve
 - Unknown at this point will need to think it out a litte bit better.

## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup
It was dark. The world was whispers, and whisps of sensation. He felt cold. Like the warmth of life was leaving him. As the christ did before, Leonello cast his fate to God. It was then that the putrid taste filled his mouth. That filth was followed by ecstasy, bliss. Then the world went truly dark. Life was pain. Minutes, hours, days, years, eternities passed and all that existed was pain. Finally, after what seemed like lifetimes, he awoke. Hungry. 

The man before him would have been handsome if not for the scrunched batlike nose, the misshapen ears, and the bald veiny head, matched with the perfect teeth, and square jawline. The words he was saying made no sense. What was he talking about? Embraced? What did that mean. Why was he so hungry? Why did the waif that the man held out to him look so delicious? 

Blood, Hunger, Fear, Loathing, A flood of memories. The streets, abuse, hunger, a tall broad man in a cloak. Ecstasy, Exhileration, Sadness.

The man spoke again, this time of rules, this time of a new life, this time of a favour owed by Carlo. 

It was late when the speaking stopped. Late when he learned of what this all means. Late when he saw what he'd become. 

Late when the consequences of Carlo's choices struck home. Late when the rage settled in Leonello's heart. For lost were his roguish good looks, lost was his smile, lost was his family, lost were his brothers, and lost was his life, and lost were the rose tinted glasses through which Leonello looked upon his 'Best Friend'. __It was all Carlo's fault__.

Years pass in the life of a Nosferatu of Florence. Hardly noticed by the other clans high and low. But, Leonello is watching. Waiting. Longing for the time to repay Carlo for his betrayal.
