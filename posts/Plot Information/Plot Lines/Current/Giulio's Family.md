# Giulio's Family

## Primary Character Focus
- [[Carlo du Vido]]
- [[Characters/Ghouls/Giulio du Vido]]
- Giulio's Family

## Main Goal
Giulio is a ghoul living his _normal_ life among his family and business partners. Where could that possibly go wrong?

## Steps to Achieve
 - Ordered list of steps to complete the main goal

## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup
Text describing the beginning of the arc.
