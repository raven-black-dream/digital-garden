# The Hungry Shade

## Primary Character Focus
- [[Andrea Vasari]]
- [[Carlo du Vido]]
- [[Sorin]]
- [[Salamah bint Alzilal]]


## Main Goal
Kill or Banish the hungry shade, and prove one way or the other the [[Salamah bint Alzilal]]'s involvement. 

## Steps to Achieve
 - Recieve note from [[Pietro]]
 - Investigate the situation
 - Associate it with the book thus Ercole
 - Investigate the Tremere Chantry
 - More investigation to find the Hungry Shade
 - Fight/Kill/Banish the Hungry Shade

## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup
It was the third night of the Florence Chantry's retreat into seclusion. [[Ercole]] stood in the ritual chamber that he had been preparing for weeks. The author of [[In Pontem Umbrae]] left so many details out. How large was the circle supposed to be? Which sigils were you supposed to put around it. Which were the sigils of binding? This research had taken him months. Thankfully, that Nosferau Lacky of [[Giovanna Rosso]]'s had been useful in getting the book. That harpy Hildegaard wouldn't have his blood, nor confirmation that it was actually him looking into the abyss. Or perhaps he should style it the Abyss, as the author always had. He had thought that stupid the whole time he was reading the text. The author revered the place as if it were alive. Stupid Stupid Stupid. 

He would not be fooled. The abyss is just a plane of existance between the living world and the land of the dead. It just so happened to manifest in shadows. None of that even hints at the possibility that the shadows actually live, nor that the 'Abyss' has anything like sentience. Leave it to the Lasombra to try to add even more ridiculous mysicism to a rarely studied branch of magic. Just because they needed their feared Discipline of Obtenebration doesn't mean that a Tremere does. 

Now, if the formulae that he had compiled from the few other books on the Abyssal Summoning that he was working on were correct then it should be a simple matter of applying the Vitae to the circle, then channelling his will through the sigils. While reciting the litany of the Hungry Shade. Tomorrow night he would begin.

The ritual was long, it was arduous, but it was no worse than countless other rituals he's performed. Until the shadows started whispering to him. Until just before moonset the shade stepped from the shadows in the circle. Until it ignored his instructions to "Kill Giovanna, Childe of Christophoro D'este". Until he was peirced, and staked, and his vitae painted the walls of the ritual chamber.

The last thing he sees before the Abyss claims him is the shadow slinking from the ritual chamber, and disappearing into the Chantry.

Our coterie recieves a note from [[Pietro]]:
"Unto Andrea of the Coterie of Searchers a Good Night,

This night troubling news crossed my desk. It appears that there are reports of shadows ripping people apart in the Merchant's Sector of the City. Please confirm whether the Lasombra in your company is to blame, and handle the situation.

Respectfully,
Pietro
Seneschal of Florence, under the hand and seal of Marcus, Prince of Florence.
"

The note carries both a tone of suspicion for the Lasombra as well as a desire for the situation to be handled.
