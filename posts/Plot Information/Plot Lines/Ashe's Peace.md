Establish a peace treaty between Ashe and the near by Lupine packs

## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup
In the forest near the Median border a pack moot is happening. Voices are raised.

"We are not sending another of our Kin to die to the hands of the Wyrm in that place. We have tried to be reasonable. We have tried to make peace. It is time for making war agianst her"

"Have you not seen the toll she has taken on our warriors, Jacob? We cannot fight this Child of the Wyrm she will drain us to the last. We must find peace with her"

"Fine, since you are insisting you go. You seek her Peace. We shall wait to hear your calls in the Spirit Realm."

"Maybe we can find a negotiator? I give me 1 moon, I will seek peace with her. "
