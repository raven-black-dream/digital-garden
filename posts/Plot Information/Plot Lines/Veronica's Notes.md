## Setup
Marcus sits stewing. It has been 40 years and the best minds in this Cain Forsaken City couldn't turn up whatever book his incompetent Childer's Harpy used for her cypher. The City hangs on tenter hooks awaiting the resolution of this problem. The system of weights and measures in the City was broken. 

Marcus turns to Pietro as if to ask but then says out loud "If I throw out the old boons there will be riots in the catacombs. My city will be wracked with unrest. Yet, the notes of the old Harpy are indecypherable. What is there to be done?"

Pietro stands pensive looking at Marcus. He knows that Marcus is musing. Not actually asking a question. 

"What am I to tell the Primogen Council, Pietro? That the best minds in the City can't come up with a way to decrypt the single most important document that exists within her walls right now? What solution can we provide?"

"We seek their advice, Prince. Though, there is a thought that I have. I wonder if the voracious reader Andrea, and his Library Assistant Ghoul Maria could solve the problem."

"Then there is the matter of the two interlopers. The Tzimisce and that Lasombra. Seeking Asylum. Do we lean on this Nosferatu in the Open, and his Brujah compatriot, to keep an eye on them too?"

"Carlo is good in a fight, my Prince. He did kill quite a few of the Inquisition when he was barely a fledgeling. I am sure that they can handle both things. Besides what information I have for the Lasombra suggests that they might be of use to Andrea."

"Okay, old friend. Let us stir the hornet's nest. Call a meeting of the Primogen Council; Then have the Gangrel call a general court."
