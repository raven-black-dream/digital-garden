## Main Goal
Determine who stole from [['abd al Dhami]]'s collection of stored vials of Heart's Blood, and deal with the situation

## Steps to Achieve
 - Investigate

## Smaller Arcs
Will depend strongly on Player choices.  Once I have better outlines of the time between periods it will be more useful.

- Also an unordered list of smaller arcs (preferrably links)

## Setup

Yet again, hunters at his door. When would they learn that he was not as easy to claim as a Visier? At least they weren't sending teams after him any more. That was always more complicated. The tacit support of the Prince helps the situation a little. 

The city had returned to a tense state of equilibrium. The catacombs were quiet. He was far from Elysium now, taking the round about way to his Haven. One never knows when one might be followed. The 'Meeting' was a very poorly disguised ambush.
