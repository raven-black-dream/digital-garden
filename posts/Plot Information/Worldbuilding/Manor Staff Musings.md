title: "Manor Staff Musings"

Andrea's treating the household staff like _his_ staff. Not joint with Carlo, not the coterie's staff, _his_. Not a shared resource, but personal, regardless of how they had originally been provisioned. Thus Andrea would probably let the staff shrink a bit naturally from what the Prince had set up for the coterie of 3.

The pay was already very good (based on comments from when getting to know the staff) _and then_ there was the substantial raise for everyone after the fire. Andrea's probably continued to pay the staff extremely well.

He kind of passively encourages the staff to have their own lives outside of the manor. Not actively "You should go out into the world and do stuff!! Now! Go!" but passively, casually, conversations in the halls of "How are things? How is ~insert important relation here~? How did that thing you were going to do go? etc". It's a mix of friendly-coworker-small-talk, Nosferatu-keeping-track-of-everything, road-of-humanity-seeing-them-as-people, and feels-responsible-for-the-wellbeing-of-his-herd.

Those two combined mean that the staff themselves may occasionally come to Andrea to ask for a job for someone in their circle - a friend they met that's struggling to make ends meet, a cousin that moved to town, their own children, whatever.

As various staff make it to old age, the phase out would look something like part time / partial retirement, and then full retirement but keeping in touch to a certain extent.

Given that most of the staff are in their teens or twenties, they'd be in their 50s or 60s by the time skip. Any of the older (during the first arc) staff would have long since retired, but some of the younger staff may still be working or half-retired.

3 of the 15 staff died in the original arc, 3 have since been ghouled, which leaves 9 more. Let's say some of the day staff were older (including Maria's mother), maybe 4 of them have since either retired or died? Let's give at least one of the younger ones an option of ~ just leaving ~ somehow, say one who "didn't really want to talk", Luciano. That would leave Franco, Marco, and 2 more of the previous day staff still around and older. Let's say Andrea's added one new (younger) person in the 40 years via a request. So that would give a staff of 8 - [[Luca]], [[Maria]], [[Lucia]], [[Franco]], [[Marco]], and 3 more, now named [[Alfonso]], [[Lorenza]], and [[Cecilia]].


He may also wind up "adopting" (heavy air quotes there) some staff in interesting circumstances. I'd leave that to if it happens to come up in the story, and won't put any of that in the time skip, but if whatever happens that some mortal or other ends up 'stranded' he may offer to have them join the staff. I'm thinking potential situations like with Gianna, but where he couldn't just keep the "bystanders" of the situation (Gianna's kid for example) oblivious to the existence of vampires. Or situations like when he attempted to "rescue" Christophero's former ghoul from [[Paolo]]. Basically odd one off situations where the staff gets another member added probably crop up occasionally.

There's also the future possibility of additions from the family line of Maria and Luca... but for the time skip I didn't factor that in.

Overall, he's actually just letting the staff slowly shrink over the 40 years and not trying to actively build it up a lot.
