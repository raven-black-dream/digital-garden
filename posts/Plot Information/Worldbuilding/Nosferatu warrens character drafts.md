Jacobella - a spite embrace from the 13th century of a beautiful court lady
In life she went by Bella, as a Nosferatu she commonly goes by Jac
Obfuscate heavy - will frequently change her appearance; donns her human face or those of other beautiful women to pass in human society, and will change her appearance sometimes in the Nosferatu warrens to appear even more hideous than her curse
spiteful of what she lost but also scorns and mocks those who seek beauty
she and Pietro bonded somewhat over being spite embraces

Vincent (Vincentius) - a hunched old Nosferatu that lives in an outpost and mostly refuses to talk directly to other vampires, or humans. Derisively sometimes known as 'the rat man', he has entire legions of rat ghouls, and a few other creatures. Quinn and Thomas know / sometimes interact with several of his ghouls.

Constantin and Domenico - two Potence-heavy Nosferatu brothers
they spend much of their time digging and were the original builders of a vast amount of the present Nosferatu warrens

Dina - She was a Nun in life, the lead of her convent's choir
as a Nosferatu she stays mostly hidden, and will use her voice as a lure or disembodied distraction, having perfected it over centuries
If one hears eerie music, disembodied wails, or haunting chants in the warrens, it is likely her  -> Daughter of Cacophany (not Nosferatu)

Volta - a scholar of a Nosferatu, there is one part of her the clan's curse left, or perhaps enhanced by making stand out: her glittering, piercing, eyes that can seem to see right through you
She rarely interacts socially, having mostly turned inward and downward, building her own library-of-sorts beneath most of the Nosferatu warrens
