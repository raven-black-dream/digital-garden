# The Court of Florence
## Basic Info
The Court plays lip service to the Camarilla. But, [[Marcus]] the Prince of the city is too old to really be bullied by the rest of the structure. So, he will run his city as he sees fit. This has resulted in him telling the people who are wanting to take [['abd al Dhami]] for the Blood Hunt to take him if they can. But, not rendering any assistance. 

At the point that the story starts the old Harpy's notes have yet to be decrypted. This poses a significant problem. The kindred economy is running on recent boons only of late, and that is throwing the balance of powers out of whack.

Marcus spent the first several years with the cityâ€™s reins in his iron fist - put a harpy in place, but otherwise changed nothing. Lots of corporal punishment, seneschal was staked and left for the sun. Lots of work for Sheriff and Scourge. Made Pietro the Seneschal and started putting other people in place over the next several decades. 

In the last decade or so, Marcus has lapsed into his preferred role delegating the running of specific things to the people who should be in charge of those things.
