# Florence Chantry
The Florence Chantry of the Tremere is but an empy shell of what it once was. All that stands is their tower. Inaccessable from the mortal world. 

The mortals of Florence think of it as a folly. A strange architectural work with no real purpose. It has been many years since anyone has thought to try to enter it via the "gate" which seems now to be immovable.

The chantry is accessable through the catacombs though. Though a little frought with traps. It is definitely not safe to try to break into the once secret lair of the Tremere.

## Traps from the Catacomb Side
- [x] #todo Come up with a list of traps and a map of the tower. (tardis like)
