### Clan Weakness
Rarefied taste has its cost, as the Ventrue are restricted to one particular type of mortal (merchants, French, Catholics, small children). This choice severely limits their feeding pool. They can consume mortal blood outside of this selected preference, but it does not forestall the Beast or provide nourishment.

- Regain a point of Willpower whenever you motivate another character to succeed as a result of your own shining example

## Back Story
### Arc 1 Summary
#### [[< 01-01-1466]]
##### Mortal History
Giovanna was born as Lucia Cellini to a minor merchant family (in the Arte dei Linaioli e Rigattieri - Guild for retail merchants and tailors) and was taught the art of sewing and tailoring from a young age. Her family dealt in fabrics and promised her to the oldest son and heir of another fabric merchant family in the same guild: Raffaello Rosso. They were married when Giovanna was 16 and Raffaello was 34, and immediately Giovanna performed her wifely duties and had several children. Some survived, many didn’t, and some survived until adulthood, only to be taken by Death in battle or childbirth. While she attended to her children and husband, she also was the primary tailor for her husband’s business.

Giovanna herself lost her husband in 1417 when she was 32. By law, their eldest son - Giovanni - was Raffaello’s heir. As her son was 16 at the time of his father’s death, he could inherit and by custom Giovanna would return to her parents’ home while her younger children remained with her husband’s family. However, Giovanna advised her son to defer to her in matters of the business and to allow her to continue as a tailor, since if she were to leave a significant amount of the business would likely follow wherever her skills went.

For five years, Giovanna ran all aspects of the business, using her son as the face of the operation and her eldest daughters as childcare until they themselves married and moved into their husband’s homes. It was during this time that she unofficially began going by Giovanna Rosso as she desired more credit for the work she was doing in her son’s name. It chafed at her that as a woman she had to hide in the shadows when she was obviously so much better than even her husband at his work. She grew the business, directed her son’s decisions, employed her other children as they were able, and commanded the loyalty of hundreds of customers - all without the authority, esteem, or influence she was due.

Cristoforo d’Este watched all of this from his own place in the shadows. He had been interested in Raffaello and thought of creating a new Ventrue from the merchant class, but something had been lacking. So he waited, and he watched as Raffaello died of an illness, or age - it didn’t really matter in the end, it was no true loss - and he saw a 16 year old boy pick up the reins effortlessly. Perhaps the boy was actually the answer - but he needed some time to mature.

Then Cristoforo saw behind the curtain and realized where the real work had taken place. Raffaello’s wife - a woman he had thought lovely, young, and talented, but with no real potential - had been hiding a shrewd business mind and a talent for persuasion. She piqued Cristoforo’s interest and he waited to see how she would develop. He began sending his ghoul to her shop and commissioning clothing. The craftsmanship was exquisite. He requested, through his ghoul, for the shop to remain open late several times so he himself may get fitted, and speak with the woman. He wanted to make sure she was the right choice, but he also wanted her to take his offer when he chose to make it. So he began to subtly influence her through his Kindred powers. He wondered if he should make her a ghoul first to establish that bond.

Over time he watched her get more and more frustrated with having to stay hidden and he made his visits more frequently. He was a noble, with plenty of money to spend and significant influence in the city, so it wasn’t entirely unusual and even drove more business to her family. She wondered if he wanted more than clothing and fabric from her - and she was right, just not in the way she thought.

Late one night he watched her make some final alterations to an ornate doublet with fine embroidery and he decided that it was finally time to make his offer. He asked if she was happy with her life, and her role in the business. She demurred, but he Commanded her to tell the truth and every angry thought and regret spilled from her lips. He asked whether she would accept if he offered her a way to be free and a way to find power in her own right. Her agreement came easily before she paused and looked to the rooms where her children slept.

Cristoforo reminded her that her son was 22 and perfectly capable of continuing the business after her years of tutelage. Maria, her eldest daughter, was a respectable seamstress and could continue on her own work if asked. There were enough children who were of age who could care for the younger ones, and there was enough money for dowries and to keep the family comfortable for years, even if business declined after her departure.

When she wondered what she would tell them, he suggested (with the subtle push of several years of conditioning) that she leave a note explaining she’d left to be with him now that the family was safe. He knew he could easily write later and explain her death so no one continued looking for her, and so no one wondered about the lack of a body.

With her final agreement, she kissed her sleeping children goodbye, wrote a note explaining everything (as she knew it), and left with Cristoforo that night.

Before dawn she had been turned into the newest Ventrue in the city, and had killed a noble that Cristoforo had captured for her to have as a first meal.

#### [[01-15-1466]]
Giovanna wakes up to Piero, her ghoul, as she does every night. She adjourns to the salon to complete some business and hears a tapping on her window. She sends Piero to investigate.

It's an owl, cracking the glass. Piero lets the owl in and it changes to a tall man wearing out of date hunting clothes - [[Carlo(Herald)]]

He has a summons from the Prince. He turns back into an owl and breaks the window as he leaves. Giovanna tasks Piero with getting it fixed.

She changes into Prince-audience clothing, and on her way through the catacombs she sees a limping, bedraggled shape walking next to the Sheriff. She doesn't engage with them.

Prince Cosimo draws her attention to the hallway crucifixion - it's a Nosferatu nailed to the cross

Prince leads her into the council chambers where [['abd al Dhami]], in his killing clothes, and [[Pietro]] are waiting ominously.

The Prince grants her domain and herd in exchange for taking on the new Kindred (Brujah and Nosferatu). Doesn't want to see her again until they're ready for presentation.

Giovanna arrives in the library to meet the new Kindred. Uses Awe in order to make a good first impression. She is there to teach them the Traditions and make them presentable for Kindred society. [[Carlo du Vido]] isn't interested in learning the rules, but Giovanna tries to convince him he only needs to learn the basics in order to stay in Kindred society, then he can choose what he wants to do.

The fledgelings are hungry, so [[Nico]] offers food in exchange for a minor boon. Carlo hunger frenzies on the cow and destroys it. Giovanna owes Nico a cow. While that happens, Giovanna tells [[Andrea Vasari]] about disciplines and Nico shows him Obfuscate 1.

*They follow with burning hands and bellies. But, you'll find no sanctuary from the cross* - Nico

When talking to [[Ercole]] to send him to Nico, he tells Carlo to take off his bloody shirt, and then lights the shirt on fire. Carlo fear frenzies and takes off through the library, causing destruction and chaos.

Giovanna and Andrea follow and find Carlo ruined an expensive white on white silk brocade chair that belongs to the Prince.

The new coterie heads to their new manor.
