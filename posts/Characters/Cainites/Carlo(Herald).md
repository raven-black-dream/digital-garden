## Other Plot Notes

Carlo is the Herald of Florence. He has some secret which the Prince is using to keep him stuck in the position even though he would rather do anything else.

This has resulted in a significant degree of sass from him. He prefers to deliver messages as notes, in his owl form. As well. he tends to leave places a little worse for wear.

[[Marcus]] once covered up an unsanctioned destruction when Carlo killed some Ventrue's childer (who Marcus didn't particularly like, probably), which is why Carlo continues being Herald despite his obvious disdain. Marcus also "arranged" for that Ventrue's sire to be destroyed at some point in the following century.
