Lasombra cannot be seen in any sort of reflective surface, which makes it difficult to conceal their supernatural nature from mortals.

- The Fanatic has a purpose that consumes her existence. She may even feel guilty undertaking an object that deviates from the higher goal.
- Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish something directly relating to your cause.

### Demeanor - Rogue
- The Rogue only cares about one thing: herself. She is not necessarily a thug or bully; she simply has her own best interests in mind at all times.

## Back Story

Salamah was born in the Emirate of Granada in 1409 to parents she doesn't remember and never knew. Her first memory is being taught to distract merchants so other children could steal food. By the age of nine she was pickpocketing unsuspecting wealthy men and learning to pick locks. As she grew older, she began disguising herself as more and more masculine - cutting her hair and binding her breasts - to avoid being forced into the prostitution ring of the street gang she ran with. The gang leaders only cared that she made more money in a night than they would get from selling sex, so she worked hard to hit bigger and bigger targets.

She often would escape to her treasured hiding place to avoid the gang leaders' wrath. When she was young she had tried thieving from the university library - having heard there were rare books she could sell to people with more money than intelligence for them to display proudly as if they had read them. Instead she found herself caught by the librarian who misinterpreted the situation and thought she was a child enamored by books, but unable to read. To avoid the guard, she agreed to him teaching her to read and, much to her astonishment, she followed through and actually enjoyed it. As she aged, she devoured books with reckless abandon, sometimes stealing away there for days at a time - the librarian would leave a cot and blanket and she often curled up there and read until her eyes closed of their own volition or the candle went out.

As the gang leaders demanded more and more from her, pushing her to join the other prostitutes, Salamah began spending more time at the university in general. She was at an age where she could have been admitted were she wealthy, educated, and male, so aside from the grime baked into her skin (which she tried to wash off before every visit) and her shabby clothing (she stole a robe specifically to wear at the university), she fit right in.

She started sitting in the back of classes and just listening to the lectures and learning what she could. She believed with enough knowledge she could figure a way off the street.

And it worked. The librarian gave her work to do and a place to sleep. She secretly attended lectures and then discussed the topics with the librarian late into the evening. She was finally finding her place in the world.

(insert more issues here from her sire)

But street gangs never let you go that easily. The gang leaders demanded what they called a 'final payment' to release her from her obligations, and it was steep. She panicked, refused to tell the librarian of her troubles, and planned a heist, bigger than she ever had before.

This time though, she didn't get away with it. Whether her skills were rusty or someone had tipped off her mark, she didn't know, but she was caught by the guard and thrown into a jail.

Time passed. Years, probably, but she wasn't really sure. All she knew was the darkness of the cell she had been thrown into. Still she held on, confident she'd be able to get out one day.

One day the darkness talked back when she spoke to it. She wasn't entirely surprised, at least until an actual shape coalesced in her cell. [[Malik]] introduced himself and explained that he wanted to offer her a chance for freedom. The embrace, he explained, would give her powers she could only dream of and she'd be free to escape this hell and forge whatever path she wished. She agreed, he embraced her, and she awoke with a deadly Hunger and her own lockpicks but otherwise alone in the cell.

She does not fully remember her escape. There was a lot of blood and screaming, and she finally felt full as she emerged into the night to see Malik waiting for her.
