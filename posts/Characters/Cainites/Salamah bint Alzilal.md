- Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish something directly relating to your cause.

### Demeanor - Rogue
- The Rogue only cares about one thing: herself. She is not necessarily a thug or bully; she simply has her own best interests in mind at all times.

## Back Story

Salamah was born in the Emirate of Granada in 1409 to parents she doesn't remember and never knew. Her first memory is being taught to distract merchants so other children could steal food. By the age of nine she was pickpocketing unsuspecting wealthy men and learning to pick locks. As she grew older, she began disguising herself as more and more masculine - cutting her hair and binding her breasts - to avoid being forced into the prostitution ring of the street gang she ran with. The gang leaders only cared that she made more money in a night than they would get from selling sex, so she worked hard to hit bigger and bigger targets.

She often would escape to her treasured hiding place to avoid the gang leaders' wrath. When she was young she had tried thieving from the university library - having heard there were rare books she could sell to people with more money than intelligence for them to display proudly as if they had read them. Instead she found herself caught by the librarian who misinterpreted the situation and thought she was a child enamored by books, but unable to read. To avoid the guard, she agreed to him teaching her to read and, much to her astonishment, she followed through and actually enjoyed it. As she aged, she devoured books with reckless abandon, sometimes stealing away there for days at a time - the librarian would leave a cot and blanket and she often curled up there and read until her eyes closed of their own volition or the candle went out.

As the gang leaders demanded more and more from her, pushing her to join the other prostitutes, Salamah began spending more time at the university in general. She was at an age where she could have been admitted were she wealthy, educated, and male, so aside from the grime baked into her skin (which she tried to wash off before every visit) and her shabby clothing (she stole a robe specifically to wear at the university), she fit right in.

She started sitting in the back of classes and just listening to the lectures and learning what she could. She believed with enough knowledge she could figure a way off the street.

And it worked. The librarian gave her work to do and a place to sleep. She secretly attended lectures and then discussed the topics with the librarian late into the evening. She was finally finding her place in the world.

(insert more issues here from her sire)

(insert more about why she was jailed - didn't like the previous bit)

Time passed. Years, probably, but she wasn't really sure. All she knew was the darkness of the cell she had been thrown into. Still she held on, confident she'd be able to get out one day.

One day the darkness talked back when she spoke to it. She wasn't entirely surprised, at least until an actual shape coalesced in her cell. [[Malik]] introduced himself and explained that he wanted to offer her a chance for freedom. The embrace, he explained, would give her powers she could only dream of and she'd be free to escape this hell and forge whatever path she wished. She agreed, he embraced her, and she awoke with a deadly Hunger and her own lockpicks but otherwise alone in the cell.

She does not fully remember her escape. There was a lot of blood and screaming, and she finally felt full as she emerged into the night to see Malik waiting for her.

### Beliefs
#### Islam
>"Muhammad and al-Qurʾān are of the sun and light. I am of the shadowed night and pure dark of the Abyss. Islam is no longer a safe haven."
									- Salamah, upon leaving the faith

Salamah was a devout Muslim during her mortal life. It was one of the few places she felt as though she had power - everyone was the same in Allah's eyes.

#### Lasombra (Antediluvian)
There is another tale, fiercely denied by the Sabbat. It tells that Lasombra allowed for his own diablerie, to free himself from the shackles of his physical body. After that, his soul entered the Abyss, seeking to become one with it. In the process, he became more than a mere vampire, turning into an abyssal monstrosity void of any remains of humanity that were left in his undead form. Unfortunately for Lasombra, the native beings of the Abyss regarded the creature as insignificant for his past as a creature of flesh and it seeks to remedy this by causing the Abyss to collapse into the physical world, blotting the sun out forever and recreating the original world, before God created light. To this end, it has begun to use those who command Obtenebration as his sensory organs in the physical world to find a way to achieve this goal.

Salamah believes that Lasombra - theoretically diablerized in 1483 - still exists in some form within the Abyss. It has become a goal of hers, somewhat subconsciously, to search for Lasombra through her Abyssal studies.
