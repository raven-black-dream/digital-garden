### Other Traits
Road: Abyss - 5
Aura: Darkness
Willpower: 8

### Clan Weakness
Lasombra cannot be seen in any sort of reflective surface, which makes it difficult to conceal their supernatural nature from mortals. Additionally, members of the Clan of Shadows cannot abide the presence of bright light; they take an additional level of aggravated damage from any exposure to sunlight.

### Nature - Fanatic
- The Fanatic has a purpose that consumes her existence. She may even feel guilty undertaking an object that deviates from the higher goal.
- Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish something directly relating to your cause.

### Demeanor - Rogue
- The Rogue only cares about one thing: herself. She is not necessarily a thug or bully; she simply has her own best interests in mind at all times.

### Merits
Literacy (1 point): You are a learned scholar, able to both read and write. The Merit assumes that you can read and write with fluency in your native tongue, as well as Latin and any languages you may have gained through the Multi-Lingual Merit. In some chronicles, literacy can be assumed. In these cases, Illiteracy becomes a 1-point Flaw

Multi-Lingual (2 points): Through patience, study, and/or immersion, you are able to speak another language or languages with native fluency. This represents a full command over the language. For each dot of Intelligence your character possesses, you may know one other language. You may also use this Merit to reflect secret codes, cants, jargon, or sign language as well. Additional languages increase the cost of this Merit by one point per language.

### Flaws 
Outsider (1 point): This is not your native land; this is not your mother tongue. You are not from around here. Everything is strange and different, from the customs to the food. You struggle with the area’s native language (though you can get by with a purchase of the Lingua Franca Merit) and the difficulty to applicable Social rolls increases by one. 

Animate Shadow (3 points): Your shadow is not merely an absence of light in the shape of your person; it is a living, malicious entity with a will of its own. It lashes out at friends and enemies alike, tearing at the scenery and snarling at passers-by. In addition to being a frightening problem, you lose two dice from all Social rolls with Lasombra who know of your issue. 

Eerie Presence (2 points): A pervasive miasma of unease surrounds you. You exude a sense of wrongness that is palpable to mortals. This aura of fear increases the difficulty of Social rolls involving interaction with mortals by two, with the exception of Intimidation rolls.

Dark Secret (1 point): Believes Lasombra to still be a presence inside the Abyss

## Obtenebration
### Shadow Play
While this ability does not allow characters to create shadows that do not already exist, it allows one to manipulate, move, and animate ambient shadows. This can grant social effects, such as using shadows to make yourself more imposing, or shape an environment to suit your needs, creating areas of shadow in which to hide a person or object. 

System: Spend one blood point to add one die to a character’s Intimidation and Stealth dice pools for the remainder of the scene. While this power is active, characters may also move, change, and animate shadows, which can include separating them from their original source. This can include moving shadows in such a way as to allow the character to see better, which reduces any penalty incurred by darkness by the amount of the character’s Obtenebration rating. Mortals find this power terrifying to behold and must pass a Courage check of 7. If they fail, their Social dice pools are reduced by one when they see this power in use.

### Nocturne
By concentrating on summoning forth darkness, Lasombra with this ability can summon a writhing cloud of supernatural darkness to engulf an area and obscure all sources of light. The darkness is a manifestation of the Abyss that muffles sound and sight and smothers the life out of the weak. The character who summons it must actively maintain it; the cloud dissipates as soon as the character’s concentration is broken. 

System: To use this ability, roll Manipulation + Occult with a difficulty of 7. Success results in a cloud of impenetrable blackness 10 feet (or three meters) in diameter anywhere within 50 yards/meters of the character. Each additional success may add ten feet/three meters to diameter of the cloud, at the caster’s discretion. The caster may choose to affect an area not in his line of sight, but at a difficulty of 9, and they must spend one point of blood. All Perception pools are reduced by five dice and the difficulties of all rolls from characters within the cloud are increased by two. Characters with supernatural methods of enhancing Perception, such as Heightened Senses (Auspex 1) or the Merit Darksight take only a two-dice penalty to their Perception. Additionally, the cloud is a breach of the Abyss into the material world; let loose into the world of the living, it will attempt to drain the life from any beings caught in it. Characters inside the cloud have their Stamina pools reduced by two. For mortals, if this reduces their Stamina pool to zero or lower, they suffocate.

### Arms of Ahriman
With this ability, a Lasombra shapes the darkness into tentacles that can attack, restrain, and grapple foes. 

System: Using this ability requires a roll of Manipulation + Occult, difficulty 7. Each success allows a character to create one tentacle six feet in length that must originate in a source of shadow within 20 feet/ 7 meters of the caster, with Strength and Dexterity ratings equal to the caster’s Obtenebration rating. If the caster desires, they may spend blood to increase Strength and Dexterity at the cost of one blood per point increased; they may also increase the length by spending one blood per six feet/ two meters of length per tentacle. Each tentacle has four health levels, does not take wound penalties, and soaks non-aggravated damage by rolling Stamina + Fortitude equal to the caster’s rating. Aggravated damage may not be soaked. Tentacles may attack characters by using Dexterity to attack for Strength + 1 points of bashing damage. Controlling the tentacles requires a moderate amount of concentration on the part of the caster. The tentacles receive one independent action; they act in concert as the caster directs.

### Nightshades
This ability allows Cainites to craft lifelike images and illusions out of darkness that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. The created illusions are still shadows, and last only so long as your character concentrates on them. They can create silhouettes and shades, but are quickly rendered unbelievable in any strong lighting. 

System: The player rolls Wits + Occult, difficulty 7. For each success, the character may create one image that the size of a human or smaller, or they may pool their successes to create one very large illusion. Characters who see these illusions must pass a Perception + Alertness roll with difficulty 9 to see through the illusion. Alternately, the caster may fill an area up to 10 meters per success with primordial visions of chaos, dark reflections of the Abyss and its denizens. This breach of the Abyss causes fear in all who behold it. Characters without Obtenebration have all dice pools reduced by two and their Initiative reduced by three.

## Abyss Mysticism Rituals
### Eyes of the Abyss (1)
With this ritual, the Abyss Mystic summons tiny denizens of the Abyss to act as her servants, most often being used as spies. System: The vampire crushes a small flame(e.g. a lit candle) in her bare hand, taking a level of aggravated damage. She then makes a Rötschreck check, difficulty 4. If she succeeds, roll Intelligence + Occult, difficulty 6. A botch results in an additional level of aggravated damage. On a success, a tiny Abyss elemental is summoned and consumes the extinguished flame.

The creature remains a number of nights equal to the successes rolled. The elemental will respond to and obey all commands given by the caster. It cannot affect the material world, though it can communicate mentally by entering a person’s shadow. Any non-mystic who communicates with an Abyss elemental in such a fashion must make a Courage check, difficulty 6. Failure results in a temporary Derangement that lasts the remainder of the evening. On a botch, the Derangement is permanent and can only be cured through repeated use of Willpower. The elemental is always in shadow form (as Tenebrous Avatar, see p. 230), can fly 30 yards/meters per turn, and is instantly destroyed by fire or sunlight. A level 2 version of this ritual, Talons of the Abyss, can summon shadow elementals that are corporeal and can even attack enemies.

### Comforting Darkness (2)
The Abyss can heal as well as harm. Using this power, the vampire draws darkness into herself and uses it to heal her wounds. However, there is a price to be paid, and the Abyss will claim it in blood. 

System: Once this ritual is cast, the vampire spends a Willpower point and makes a Stamina + Occult roll (difficulty 8). If she botches, the darkness burns them, and she takes an aggravated level of damage. If she succeeds, she may then spend one blood point for each success, regardless of Generational limits. For each blood point she spends in this way, she may heal two levels of bashing or lethal damage. Unfortunately there is an additional cost before the darkness inside is sated. All blood the vampire consumes feeds the dark inside, not even entering her own system. This goes on until twice as much blood has been consumed as was originally spent. Until this cost is paid, the Cainite cannot use this ritual again. It can also only be used once each night. 

Side Effect: The taint of darkness never leaves the caster’s blood, turning it a dark ruddy hue, almost black, forever.

### Abyssal Blade (2)
Abyss Mystics are assassins and warriors as often as they are cloistered scholars; the Abyssal Blade ritual grants them a deadly force against even the most hardened of opponents. The Abyss wreathes around a Mystic’s edged weapon, coating the metal in a swirling ichor of shadow. The ritual enables the blade to cut through armor as if it were immaterial, and inflict wounds impossible for mortals to heal.

System: The Abyss Mystic must immerse the blade of his weapon in the blood of any living creature, holding the weapon’s handle as she dedicates her future kills to the Abyss. She rolls Strength + Occult (difficulty 7), with success imbuing the weapon with an unholy power allowing a weapon to bypass armor — not Fortitude — and inflict aggravated damage on mortals. Each success results in the weapon remaining imbued for a night. Once the power runs out, the weapon corrodes and becomes useless. The ritual can be enacted more than once on the same weapon, prior to corrosion. Failure leads to no result; a botch causes the weapon to corrode immediately, and prevents the ritual from being incanted again that night.

### Claiming the Dark (3)
This ritual allows the caster to merge with the shadows, drawing the power of the Abyss into herself. However, the cost for this power, as always, is blood. 

System: When casting this ritual, the vampire cuts herself open with a knife and draws the surrounding shadows into her own body. The process takes an hour and is very painful, subtracting two dice from any rolls the Cainite makes for the duration. After this torment, the vampire makes a Manipulation + Occult roll (difficulty 8) to hold the power of the shadows inside her. If she fails, the shadows escape her, and if she botches, the shadows take a blood point for each 1 rolled as well. If she succeeds, her skin turns dark and her eyes become black. All her physical attributes rise to the level of their Obtenebration if they are lower. Obtenebration powers up to level three are used at -2 difficulty, and the blood point cost for Arms of the Abyss is halved. This augmentation lasts for as long as the vampire desires. Unfortunately, upon rising from slumber each night, the vampire in this condition must pay an additional blood point cost equal to their Obtenebration rating. Should she fail to do so, she returns to normal. In her augmented form, she is also more vulnerable to sunlight and takes triple damage from it. Her Appearance also drops by one point while empowered. 

Side Effect: Should the vampire spend more consecutive days in this form than her highest Virtue, her skin begins to darken permanently, in a similar way to elder Assamites.

### Maw of Ahriman (4)
Once a caster has invoked this ritual, her mouth becomes a portal to the Abyss. She may not speak or make sounds, and anyone looking into her mouth will see a deep chasm of blackness beyond instead of the workings of human physiology.

System: The caster may consume anything she can fit into her mouth, eradicating the item (or creature, or part of a creature) utterly by absorbing it into the Abyss. Biting an opponent deals aggravated damage as per a standard bite, but also removes one Willpower dot from the opponent’s total Willpower. Willpower lost in this manner may not be regained for one lunar month. The effects of this ritual last until the next sunrise, or the caster may end the ritual at any time.

Side Effect: The caster cannot speak or otherwise use her vocal cords, mouth, tongue, or fangs for the duration of this ritual’s effects.

## Back Story

Salamah was born in the Emirate of Granada in 1409 to parents she doesn't remember and never knew. Her first memory is being taught to distract merchants so other children could steal food. By the age of nine she was pickpocketing unsuspecting wealthy men and learning to pick locks. As she grew older, she began disguising herself as more and more masculine - cutting her hair and binding her breasts - to avoid being forced into the prostitution ring of the street gang she ran with. The gang leaders only cared that she made more money in a night than they would get from selling sex, so she worked hard to hit bigger and bigger targets.

She often would escape to her treasured hiding place to avoid the gang leaders' wrath. When she was young she had tried thieving from the university library - having heard there were rare books she could sell to people with more money than intelligence for them to display proudly as if they had read them. Instead she found herself caught by the librarian who misinterpreted the situation and thought she was a child enamored by books, but unable to read. To avoid the guard, she agreed to him teaching her to read and, much to her astonishment, she followed through and actually enjoyed it. As she aged, she devoured books with reckless abandon, sometimes stealing away there for days at a time - the librarian would leave a cot and blanket and she often curled up there and read until her eyes closed of their own volition or the candle went out.

As the gang leaders demanded more and more from her, pushing her to join the other prostitutes, Salamah began spending more time at the university in general. She was at an age where she could have been admitted were she wealthy, educated, and male, so aside from the grime baked into her skin (which she tried to wash off before every visit) and her shabby clothing (she stole a robe specifically to wear at the university), she fit right in.

She started sitting in the back of classes and just listening to the lectures and learning what she could. She believed with enough knowledge she could figure a way off the street.

And it worked. The librarian gave her work to do and a place to sleep. She secretly attended lectures and then discussed the topics with the librarian late into the evening. She was finally finding her place in the world.

- expelled from uni
- Death of Librarian
- Rape?
- Doesn't really matter what she got put in jail for - can handwave it

Time passed. Years, probably, but she wasn't really sure. All she knew was the darkness of the cell she had been thrown into. Still she held on, confident she'd be able to get out one day.

One day the darkness talked back when she spoke to it. She wasn't entirely surprised, at least until an actual shape coalesced in her cell. [[Malik]] introduced himself and explained that he wanted to offer her a chance for freedom. The embrace, he explained, would give her powers she could only dream of and she'd be free to escape this hell and forge whatever path she wished. She agreed, he embraced her, and she awoke with a deadly Hunger and her own lockpicks but otherwise alone in the cell.

She does not fully remember her escape. There was a lot of blood and screaming, and she finally felt full as she emerged into the night to see Malik waiting for her.

### Beliefs
#### Islam
>"Muhammad and al-Qurʾān are of the sun and light. I am of the shadowed night and pure dark of the Abyss. Islam is no longer a safe haven."
									- Salamah, upon leaving the faith

Salamah was a devout Muslim during her mortal life. It was one of the few places she felt as though she had power - everyone was the same in Allah's eyes.

#### Lasombra (Antediluvian)
There is another tale, fiercely denied by the Sabbat. It tells that Lasombra allowed for his own diablerie, to free himself from the shackles of his physical body. After that, his soul entered the Abyss, seeking to become one with it. In the process, he became more than a mere vampire, turning into an abyssal monstrosity void of any remains of humanity that were left in his undead form. Unfortunately for Lasombra, the native beings of the Abyss regarded the creature as insignificant for his past as a creature of flesh and it seeks to remedy this by causing the Abyss to collapse into the physical world, blotting the sun out forever and recreating the original world, before God created light. To this end, it has begun to use those who command Obtenebration as his sensory organs in the physical world to find a way to achieve this goal.

Salamah believes that Lasombra - theoretically diablerized in 1483 - still exists in some form within the Abyss. It has become a goal of hers, somewhat subconsciously, to search for Lasombra through her Abyssal studies.
