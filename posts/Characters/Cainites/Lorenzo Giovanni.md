The Clan Curse of the Giovanni is their excruciatingly painful Kiss. As the family usurped control of the Clan from the Cappadocians in the 14th century CE, they have not been cursed by Caine (although the Prophecies within the Erciyes Fragments tell about the eventual fate of the Clan, which is not very assuring). When Augustus Giovanni received the blood of Cappadocius, Japheth, arbiter of the Embrace, spoke: "He who partakes of this boon shall forever be judged by this blood and by the will of God. Color this vitae with the deeds of its drinker. Let him sup with his soul every time he feeds. Deliver this blight upon him as the Founder delivers this stigma to us."When Augustus betrayed the Cappadocians and diablerized his sire, the curse took hold. Others call the curse of the Giovanni "Lamia's Kiss", claiming it to be the curse from the Lamia bloodline, who were servants to the Cappadocians, when their leader was diablerized by Augustus.During the Dark Ages, some claimed that the pain during a great famine that Augustus had to witness in his mortal days echoed in his blood, although they were still puzzled why certain Giovanni exhibited Cappadocians traits instead.

As their feedings are most often lethal and can severely endanger the Masquerade, most Giovanni are discreet, feeding from blood banks and other secondary sources like corpses. Also, Giovanni are under no illusion that they are anything but inhuman, as each feeding session proves again.
