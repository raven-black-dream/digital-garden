## Back Story
### Between the Arcs
Sorin was born to a farming family in rural Romania in the year 1421. Sorin was raised to help those in his small community and was regarded as the strong back of his home. During his 23rd year, he went to the nearby city of Bucharest to sell some of their yield and buy medicine for his mother. Not long before sunrise, Sorin was preparing to depart back home when he was pulled into an alleyway. While the man that grabbed him was strong, Sorin overpowered him and managed to land a blow to his temple knocking him out. Sorin went to check for signs of life before he left and finding none, was panicked he had just killed his assailant. As he looked for help, a sharp pain sunk into his neck and then sweet bliss. Sorin later awoke to find his assailant, now sire, [[Tihomir Cel Bun]] (Tihomir the kind) standing over him. 

The next 35 or so years were a blur of pain, learning and planning. Sorins new sire was cruel in his education and most of his memories are from recent years as his master was distracted by an uprising of gargoyles. Sorin met a younger kindred, [[Lactu]] (Path of Humanity) who pitied what had been done. Together, the two of them slowly siphoned wealth out of his sire's funds and found an aspiring merchant who wished to leave and set up shop in the "great city of Florence". Sorin slowly brokered a deal with this merchant, [[Balc]] and later ghoulified him as the gargoyle uprising was quieting down. Seeing his only chance to escape, Sorin fled the city with Balc, who smuggled him into the city of Florence.

When Sorin arrived in Florence, he bartered with the Prince with the only thing he had of
interest. News of the uprising and politics of his previous home. Sorin still keeps in contact with Latcu via letters passed through Balc or his associates. Walking the path of Metamorphosis, Sorin now seeks ways to improve himself, going so far as to make himself harder to touch.

Sorin suffers from PTSD as well as flashbacks and sudden memories. Due to this, he does not like being touched suddenly or from behind and may lash out due to this. He has grown spines on his back to discourage this behavior from other kindred
