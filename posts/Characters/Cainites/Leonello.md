## Important Story Notes
While formerly being a ghoul to [[Carlo du Vido]] the events of the end of the last chronicle with his near death to the inquisition and subsequent embrace by [[Pietro]] leaving a bad taste in his mouth. 

Leonello is not happy with Carlo's choice to "save him." He would have preferred to have been let die than to face an immortality as a Nosferatu.
