## Other Plot Information

Vincent (Vincentius) - a hunched old Nosferatu that lives in an outpost and mostly refuses to talk directly to other vampires, or humans. Derisively sometimes known as 'the rat man', he has entire legions of rat ghouls, and a few other creatures. [[Quinn]] and [[Thomas]] know / sometimes interact with several of his ghouls.
