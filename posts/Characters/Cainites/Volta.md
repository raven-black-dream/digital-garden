## Other Plot Information

Volta - a scholar of a Nosferatu, there is one part of her the clan's curse left, or perhaps enhanced by making stand out: her glittering, piercing, eyes that can seem to see right through you
She rarely interacts socially, having mostly turned inward and downward, building her own library-of-sorts beneath most of the Nosferatu warrens
about 150 years old starting arc 2 (circa 1350)
