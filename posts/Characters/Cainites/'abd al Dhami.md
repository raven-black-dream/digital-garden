## Notes

### Quietus (Cruscitus)

The signature power of Clan Assamite actually comprises two distinct Disciplines, both known colloquially as Quietus by not only those practicing the arts, but by those merely aware of them. Scholars of Alamut recite that their founder Haqim developed the twin Disciplines of Quietus to harmoniously complement one another when he first divided  the Warriors and Viziers and assigned them duties within the tripartite society of his clan. Though traditional Assamites generally prefer to utilize the original Phoenician name of “Abed Dume” or “destroy blood,” its Latin name “Quietus,” or “settling of debts” (especially as relates to death) is most common in discussion – in no doubt due to the epithet evoked by coupling the name with either of its branches.

  

The Children of Haqim have ever seen themselves as pure and fierce judges of the righteous use of blood, separate from Caine’s other get. The Warrior Discipline Cruscitus (translated from the Phoenician “Hikmat Dume” or “blood wisdom,” defined in Latin as “the science of murder through blood”) revolves largely around the use of blood poisoning to kill. Whereas, the Vizier Discipline Hematus (translated from the Phoenician “Minhit Dume” or “blood offering,” defined in Latin as “an offering of blood”) makes use of subtle ways to manipulate vitae in aid to the tasks of mystic exploration and governance. When paired with their parent name, both Disciplines delineate their respective craft: Quietus Cruscitus as “the settling of debts by the science of murder through blood” and Quietus Hematus as “the settling of debts by an offering of blood.”

  

If your character already has one form of Quietus, the other type costs new rating x 4 XP to learn. It requires a teacher with that style of the power.

#### Blood Essence

This power provides definitive proof of a vanquished foe. Terrifying to behold, Blood Essence demonstrates one of the most frightening aspects of this Discipline: the ability to distill the essence of what Cainites refer to as the “heart’s blood,” the holy or unholy life force that contains a being’s soul. 

System: Functioning even on mortals, the character must exsanguinate his victim of all but one blood point (or drain all blood points entirely if the victim is a Cainite). He then pricks his finger and marks the victim’s bare chest, near the heart, with a speck of his vitae. The player spends one blood point, spurring the speck of vitae to seep into the target’s skin. 

Then make an extended Willpower roll (difficulty 9) imposing a level of unsoakable aggravated damage to the victim per success. 

As in diablerie, if the victim remains alert during the process, she can fight back. Should a vampire fail on the roll, he must pause, but can continue again next turn. With a botched roll, the effort fails (however, the vampire can still attempt traditional diablerie if the victim is a Cainite). 

Once all health levels have been exhausted, the vampire tears open the victim’s breast, moving past the rib cage to extract the heart. The vampire’s own blood has calcified the heart into a semi-translucent grayish-white flask known as a “Debitum.” The Debitum enshrouds the spiritual essence (the “heart’s-blood”) of the victim – which, if examined in detail, can be seen encased within, swimming in despair. Heart’s-blood preserved in this way endures indefinitely. If vampiric fangs pierce it, the heart reanimates, pumping a cupful of celadon-colored, aqueous, non-burning flame vaguely resembling the victim into the vampire’s maw. If the victim is a Cainite, upon devouring the essence, the vampire reaps all benefits and potential pitfalls of successfully diablerizing the victim, without risking the blood oath. A Debitum crumbles to ash if left vulnerable to fire or sunlight, or when emptied of its contents.

#### Scorpion’s Touch

A variation of the Hematus power: Blood Tempering, Scorpion’s Touch is derived from isolating the mechanism inherent within vampiric blood’s function of converting regular blood into sustenance. In this case, the Assamite transmutes the properties of her vitae into a powerful venom that strips prey of its resilience.

System: The player spends the number of blood points (up to her Generational per-turn limit) that she wishes to convert to poison. Roll Willpower (difficulty 6). If the roll is successful, the poison remains potent until used, but harbors a vampire’s susceptibility to fire and sunlight. 

A botch renders the blood spent inert; it cannot be used to augment Attributes, heal the vampire, or fuel Disci-plines. The poison looks and smells like normal blood and a Cainite is immune to her own poison, but not that of others utilizing this power. She may retain an amount of poisoned blood up to her maximum Generational spending limit per turn in her blood pool for later use, though any blood points converted to poison are inert for any other purpose. If the vampire is in danger of someone attempting to drink blood from her, she may rush any stored blood points to the surface as a defensive action, which may be used reflexively even if in slumber or torpor. A Cainite may also bite her tongue or lip to pool the poisoned blood in her mouth for a “kiss of death.” Likewise, she may cut her flesh to smear the poison on a pointed or edged weapon, or even place it in food, on a cup, utensil, or other seemingly innocuous item. 

Spend one blood point and one turn per cubic foot/30 liters that her chosen weapon occupies (minimum 1). A dart, arrowhead, or dagger requires a blood point and a turn to lightly coat it, while the average sword or axe may need three turns. Weapons remain poisoned for an amount of attacks equal to the Cainite’s initial Willpower roll; an envenomed weapon that is swung or fired loses the potency of its poison at a rate of one success per attack until depleted (whether it’s dodged, parried, deflected by armor, misses, or hits). Envenomed weapons bathed in water, or open to the mercy of heavy wind or rain, lose the potency of their poison the turn after exposure, while those passing through fire or sunlight lose it instantly and appear dusted in a fine ash.  

In order to be effective, the poison must be ingested or enter the target’s bloodstream, usually through drinking or being pierced by a bloodied weapon. Once the poison is delivered, the target immediately rolls Stamina (plus Fortitude, if any). At the end of his next turn, he loses a number of Stamina points equal to the number of successes on the Cainite’s Willpower roll minus successes on the target’s Stamina roll. If a living being’s Stamina falls to 0, he dies. If a vampire’s Stamina falls to 0, the vampire enters torpor and remains that way until his Stamina points return to a minimum of 1. As a defensive action vampires and ghouls may spend a blood point to heal normally and completely purge the poison from their system 

#### Dagon’s Call

With the slightest scratch delivering a dab of blood to mingle with that of the target’s, Dagon’s Call twists a victim’s vitae against him. The target’s eyes swell and take a deep burgundy hue, muscles seize and veins bulge beneath the skin, and thin trickles of vibrant scarlet bleed into tiny rivers from all openings in the anatomy. This nightmarish affliction persists until the target collapses in agony or death throes, leaving no trace of the attacker’s presence.

System: In order to use this power, the character’s blood must first be ingested or enter the target’s bloodstream, usually through drinking (even from a ghoul belonging to the character) or being pierced by a bloodied weapon. The character waits a minimum of one hour for her blood to be fully absorbed, entering the circulatory system to securely grip the victim deeply. After a moment’s concentration, the vampire bursts her target’s blood vessels, internally constricting the target’s whole body by flooding it with ruptured hemoglobin that strangles him from within. 

To activate this power, the player spends one Willpower point and rolls Perception + Awareness (difficulty equal to the vampire’s current proximity to the target or the amount of time elapsed since she touched the target, whichever is greater).

The player and target make contested Stamina rolls (difficulty of each roll equal to the opponent’s Willpower). The target suffers levels of unsoakable lethal damage equal to the number of successes on the player’s Willpower roll minus successes on the target’s Willpower roll. To continue rending her opponent from within, the player may spend additional Willpower each turn after the first, accompanied by further contested Stamina rolls, until she is defeated on a roll. A botched roll results in the vampire suffering an amount of lethal damage equal to her failures on the roll.

#### Baal’s Caress

A refinement of Scorpion’s Touch, Baal’s Caress allows a vampire to transform her blood into an acidic toxin that burns any living or undead flesh, usually accomplished by licking a blade to lubricate it before assaulting an opponent. Commonly, warriors will spit the hateful ichor or cough it forth and vomit voluminous streams of vitae that corrode their enemies into heaps of bubbling sludge.

System: Aside from the following exceptions, this power otherwise works according to the rules for Scorpion’s Touch. Rather than attacking a target’s Stamina, the stinging venom generated through Baal’s Caress only necessitates skin contact and afflicts caustic burns. Touching the caustic blood causes one level of aggravated damage per Willpower success on the initial activation. If ingested, the damage is unsoakable. Prolonged touching of envenomed objects, through holding them directly or grappling a Cainite wearing envenomed clothing or armor, causes additional damage each turn. This includes attempts to disarm envenomed weapons or objects currently wielded by the Cainite. 

Weapons coated in venom (including the vampire’s own slashed limbs, claws, or nails) cause aggravated dam-age. Add one additional die of damage per success on the activating Willpower roll. This damage bonus depletes at one point per turn, at which time, the venom is lost. Any coated weapon is destroyed by the venom at this point.

A vampire may also bite her tongue or lip to spit a single point of envenomed blood at a lone target, or regurgitate up to her maximum amount of blood point expenditure per turn and spray multiple targets. The Cainite may spit or vomit her envenomed vitae up to three feet (one meter) for each dot of Strength and Potence she possesses. Alternatively, the spray can come from an open wound, including both self-inflicted wounds and those received in combat. Spitting at a lone target requires a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll (difficulty 6) to hit, though spraying hits multiple targets as a Hail of Arrows (see p. 347). Spewed blood contacting the victim’s skin causes aggravated damage as if the blood were a thrown weapon with a damage rating equal to the vampire’s Willpower successes. 

The character may still use Scorpion’s Touch instead of Baal’s Caress.

### Obfuscate

To many common men and women living in the 13th century, the Devil lurks in every shadow and hides behind every corner. Evil is ever-present and a threat that can rarely be seen with your eyes. 

In the case of those Cainites who have mastered Obfuscate, this paranoia is justified. While evil may be debatable, Obfuscate makes it so that a gifted vampire could be lurking in the darkness ready to strike or flee at any time. The monster must be close at hand to accom-plish this,  no more than five meters per dots of Wits + Stealth from their would-be victims. 

Most mortals, even those trained in Awareness, cannot pierce the monster’s deception. Some unique individuals may be able to see straight through these lies; children, horses, dogs, some cats, and very few religious visionaries are unaffected by Obfuscate, but this is all at Storyteller discretion. 

Cainite with the Discipline of Auspex may be able to pierce a Cainite’s Obfuscate. For more, see Auspex on p. 195.

Most Obfuscate powers last a scene once activated, unless willed away by the Cainite. They take no particular concentration to uphold once raised. 

#### The Silence of Death

At this rudimentary understanding, the Cainite can make things around them fade to silence, although sounds from beyond the vicinity filter through, anything in the immediate area fades into nothingness. In most cases, this nimbus moves with the Silence of Death. 

System: There is no roll. The power creates a zone of absolute silence around the character, with a maximum radius of 7 meters. No sound occurs inside this zone, though sounds originating outside the area of effect may be heard by anyone in it. 

Additionally, if the player spends two blood points and the character spends five turns in concentration in a room or enclosure, the silence remains in it after the character leaves the room and lasts until she wills it to end. A character can’t create more than one zone of silence, so if she wishes to use Silence of Death on herself (or curse another room), the zone in the first room fades automatically.

#### Unseen Presence

At this point, the Cainite can now move about unseen. Shadows cling to her, and kine and Cainite alike look away, their minds not allowing them to see the shadowy monster that lurks in their periphery. While the Discipline protects her from being seen or heard in casual progress, any direct interaction with the world shatters the illusion. Kine will step aside, unknowing, to let an Obfuscated Cainite pass them, but should the Cainite crush a bed of roses, kick a sleeping hound, or pull on a tapestry by passing too close to it, she is outed. 

System: There is no roll necessary to conjure an Unseen Presence. Should a Cainite draw attention to herself by sneak attack, blunder, or speech, accidental attention will call for a Wits + Stealth roll, difficulty from 5 to 9, based on the amount of noise or calamity the Cainite has caused. Willful attempts to violate the secrecy of Unseen Presence while still maintaining it may call for a high dif-ficulty and multiple successes. For example, whispering to an enemy without giving away her location would require three or so successes at a difficulty of 7. Even when seen or unseen, a secondary use of this power allows a Cainite to conceal small items already on her person, or with a successful Manipulation + Subterfuge from 5 to 9, based on the amount of observation she can grasp and conceal an easily moved item.

#### Mask of a Thousand Faces

At this point, the vampire can trick the minds of her victims to hide her face in plain sight. That is to say, she may stand face to face with her victim and not have their true visage revealed. By force of mind over mind, the vampire forces her victim to see a face not her own. This may be a newly imagined character nothing like the vampire at all or slight changes to the Cainite’s own features. She may appear taller, of another region or she might even appear as a man. This ability does not confer on the vampire any special talent for imitation or acting as the face she creates; that is on the vampire’s talents alone. 

System: To create this guise, the player rolls Manipulation + Performance at a difficulty 7. To mimic the face of another, the vampire must have a good look at them. The Storyteller might raise the difficulty on the roll if the vampire has only briefly seen the person they wish to mimic. How successful the disguise is depends on the chart at the top of the page. Should a vampire wish to create a face much more appealing than her own, she must spend a point of blood for every dot of difference from her Appearance to that of the disguise. While fooling acquaintances may require only a look at the target and clever crafting of the mask, fooling someone intimately connected to the target is another matter. That requires actual familiarity with the target, and perhaps other rolls to keep the illusion going.

#### Vanish from the Mind’s Eye

The vampire now has so much control over what her victims can and cannot see that she can vanish from plain sight and other senses. Standing before her victims, she wills it so, and she simply vanishes.This can have serious ripples on those who witness the event. Vampires startle when another of their kind simply vanishes from before their eyes. Humans will actually forget that the vampire was there to begin with. Particularly weak-willed humans will panic and flee the area, though they may or may not recall the reason for their panic (at Storyteller discretion). 

System: The player rolls her character’s Intelligence + Stealth against their victim’s Wits + Alertness. If there is more than one victim, use the highest pool to resist. If the player rolls one to three successes, the vampire fades but does not vanish, appearing ghost-like and translucent. With more than three successes, the vampire vanishes from her victim’s senses entirely. If the player achieves more successes than the victim, the victim forgets that the vampire was there to begin with, and tends to not reflect on any conflict in memory that might cause. 

It is possible to interact with a ghosted vampire, though difficult. A player tracking such a vampire rolls Perception + Alertness at a difficulty of 8. On a successful roll, the character can interact normally with the ghostlike vampire, though they are likely to be disturbed by his ethereal presence. On a failure, the character loses two dice on any roll to interact with the ghostlike vampire, from attacking them to following them to seducing them. After witnessing a vampire vanish before their eyes, the player of any other character present must roll Wits + Courage. For humans, this is difficulty 9; for Cainites, difficulty 5. If the player succeeds, the character may act as expected in the situation. A failure on this roll means that the character is beside themselves and unable to act for two turns, unless that action is to flee. 

### Celerity

Celerity moves a vampire with unholy rapidity and grace. Characters with Celerity move nigh-unseen in bursts of inhuman speed. This allows for remarkable performances, frightening quick assassinations, and travel unlike any in the Dark Medieval World. 

System: Characters add their Celerity rating to their Dexterity-based dice pools, including their Initiative ratings. Add her Celerity rating to the number of yards or meters she moves in a turn.

Additionally, they may reflexively spend one point of blood to ignore difficulty penalties for multiple actions up to their Celerity dots for the turn. For example, a character with Celerity 3 makes three actions before suffering +1 difficulty for multiple actions. This does not mitigate the dice pool reduction, however. A number of these additional actions equal to half their Celerity (round up) may be attack actions. See p. 322 for rules on multiple actions.

Lastly, by spending one blood point, she may multiply her movement speed by 1 plus her Celerity dots. In combat, this lasts one turn. Otherwise, it lasts the scene.

### Backgrounds

#### Resources

-   3 points
    
-   Comfortable. You are a prominent and established member of your community, with land and an owned dwelling. You likely have more tied up in equity and property than you do in ready coin. You can maintain a one-dot quality of existence wherever you are without difficulty, for as long as you choose.

Resources are assets your character controls. These may be gold, investments, property, commercial inven-tories, or even taxes and tithes. A character with no dots in Resources may have enough clothing and supplies to get by, or she may be destitute and squatting. You receive a basic allowance each month based on your rating, so detail exactly where this money comes from. Players may purchase Resources for their characters with pooled Background points.

#### Status

-   3 points (influential, an elder)

You’ve standing within the local Cainite community. You may derive this standing from your sire’s status and bloodline, the reputation of your coterie, or your own individual deeds. High Status may make you a target for those against your faction. When interacting with local Cainites, you may roll your Status in conjunction with a Social Trait to reflect the positive effects of your prestige. As the lowest of the low, Caitiff characters may not purchase Status during character creation. 

#### Contacts

-   2 points
    
-   A major contact in 2 separate areas

Contacts are people you can manipulate or coerce into offering information. Minor contacts are spread throughout the city. Roll your Contacts rating (difficulty 7) and reach one minor contact for each success. However, you still have to convince them to give you the information. Major contacts can give you accurate information in their fields of expertise and each should be described in detail before the game begins. 

### Road of Blood

-   Level 9
    

#### Ethics of the Blood

-   The blood of Caine is a gift that must be earned.
-   Purity, honor, and discipline are the hallmarks of a warrior.
-   Do not act with haste — every action requires careful consideration.
-   Allowing the Beast to take control is a sign of weakness and unfitness to retain Caine’s blood.

#### Aura

-   Resolve
-   A follower of the Road of Blood takes his task seriously and is dedicated to following through. The aura modifier affects Willpower rolls.

#### Hierarchy of Sins
| Score | Minimum Wrongdoing | Rationale |
| :-----: | :-----------------: | :---------: |
|  10  |  Acting Impulsively  | Discipline is Strength|
| 9 | Allowing actions to be dictated by emotion| Passion is the first stirring of the Beast|
| 8 | Succumbing to Frenzy | Our will must be unshakable|
| 7 | Failing to diablerize the unworthy | Return the blood of the unworthy to Haqim|
| 6 | Acting Cowardly or Dishonorably | Our actions reflect on our father, Haqim.|
| 5 | Allowing the unworthy to go unpunished | We are judging of the unliving|
| 4 | Showing weakness before the unworthy | We represent Haqim in all things |
| 3 | Failing to honor an Oath | Our honour is what sets us apart |
| 2 | Submitting to the will of an unworthy Prince or elder | Nothing in this world may sway us from our sacred purpose |
| 1 | Becoming oath-bound to another Cainite| We serve Haqim and no other

## Other important story notes

After the events of the last chronicle 'Abd is withdrawn. He has spent the last 40 years dealing with a variety of attempts on his life, including via the Blood Hunt called on his clan by the Camarilla.

'abd took advantage of the aftermath of the Gargoyle Revolt to kill the last vestiges of Clan [[Tremere]] in the city after they placed a Blood Curse on the entirety of Clan [[Banu Haquim]]
