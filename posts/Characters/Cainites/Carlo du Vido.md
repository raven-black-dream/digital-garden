## Back Story
### Arc 1 Summary
#### [[< 01-01-1466]]

Carlo du Vido comes from a moderately successful family of wine merchants. His father, two brothers and one sister are still living. Carlo is the youngest. Both his brother's work in the family business. His sister is married to another middle class merchant and has an infant son.Â 

Unlike his siblings Carlo was a rambunctious youth with no patience for books. He always preferred action to words but did like to collect old wives tales and other stories to tell around the fire.

He started his small mercenary band with some money from his father and with the help of his two oldest friends ran it successfully.
