## Other Plot Information
250ish years old starting arc 2 (circa 1250)
Jacobella - a spite embrace from the 13th century of a beautiful court lady
In life she went by Bella, as a Nosferatu she commonly goes by Jac
Obfuscate heavy - will frequently change her appearance; donns her human face or those of other beautiful women to pass in human society, and will change her appearance sometimes in the Nosferatu warrens to appear even more hideous than her curse
spiteful of what she lost but also scorns and mocks those who seek beauty
she and [[Pietro]] bonded somewhat over being spite embraces
