## Back Story
### Arc 1 Summary
#### [[< 01-01-1466]]
As a human, Andrea was a close assistant to Francesco Sforza, a banker with close family ties to the rules of Milan, in Milan. 

#### [[01-14-1466]]
Andrea was serving as a personal guard when Francesco's cousin called in a favour for help in a battle near Florence. Carlo's mercenary group captured Francesco for ransom, nearly killed Andrea and left him to die, and killed the rest of Francesco's group.
Andrea was laying on the battlefield dying when he saw what appeared to be an angel of death, who muttered about 'this one is still alive' before dropping blood in his mouth and dragging him off.

#### [[01-15-1466]]
Andrea became conscious again through the pain to find an imp about 2' tall trying to get his attention. He met the Sheriff who took him to the library where he met Giovanna, Carlo, Nico, and Ercole. His skull was cracked and he had more scars than should be possible but was still somehow functioning through pain. Giovanna introduced him to the laws of cainite society. Nico assisted in introductory lessons for Carlo and Andrea; Andrea learned hour to spread silence and watched Carlo make a bloody mess of a cow. Ercole flamed Carlo's discarded bloody shirt which panicked Carlo who ruined a white silk chair. The group took the chair with them to the manor where they would be staying.

#### [[01-16-1466]]
Andrea met Pietro shortly after waking and found he was the one who had spoken for Andrea's sire who was now paralyzed in Elysium. Pietro gave Andrea some intensive introductions to his new cainite abilities and further information on cainite society while in the manor's crypt. Andrea discovered he had more Obfuscate ability than Pietro was expecting, but had not been given extra strength and couldn't lift the crypt's giant boulder. Animalism also went well. Pietro acted friendly and mentor like to Andrea but also expressed doubt that Andrea would survive and placed many answers behind a challenge to prove himself first. After the lesson Pietro also demonstrated that feeding needn't go how Carlo's first attempt had by using Maria, the 14 year old girl acting as the current entrance servant as an example and drinking from her wrist. She treated Andrea like the one in charge of the manor/situation by asking him for leave after which surprised Andrea. Pietro then gave Andrea a tour of the main catacomb paths ending in finding Giovanna snarling at them at the library entrance with the door in her hand. Andrea tried to collect his coterie and get them out of the library before the situation got worse as there had evidently been another incident with Carlo and a cow. He owed Ercole a favour for cleaning up the library in order to get them out quickly. Upon getting back to the manor he sent Giovanna off to find food and had the servants help clean up Carlo and himself. Luca, a tall thin 18 year old lead them off for baths and new clothes, Franco also helped Andrea. The interim new clothes were somewhat ill fitting, and Giovanna measured them for custom clothes, dictating measurements to Maria. Giovanna also gave more information about cainite courts.

#### [[01-17-1466]]
Clothes were somehow ready by the next day, and included a court set, and a hood/cloak. Andrea helped Carlo deliver an _alive_ cow to Nico using Andrea's skill in animalism in return for a minor boon from Carlo. A cow was purchased by Carlo and led by Andrea talking it through walking through the catacombs using a path with a ramp. Carlo seemed relieved to have finally finished with cows and was happy to owe Andrea saying "but you seem nice". The Prince decided he wanted Andrea and Carlo introduced in court the next day which worried Giovanna. Andrea fed for the first time off of Luca, who seemed surprisingly used to being fed from and said "that never gets old". Giovanna warned Andrea about more visceral reactions to Nosferatu, to ignore it, and that eventually he would be able to gather enough secrets that they would stop doing reacting that way. Warnings about about court.

Andrea investigates the manor, there were about 10 people including one older gentleman at a desk asleep in his chair. He also meets a friendly rat working for someone and "always watching" by the rat tunnel in the cellar. The imp from a couple days prior appeared to say hello but would not give Andrea his name before disappearing down the rat hole. Andrea dubs him Fratellino, little brother.

As Andrea left the crypt he overhead Carlo talking to Giovanna about mercenaries. He instantly recognizes Carlo from the battlefield, loses his temper, snatches up Carlo and demands to know what he did with Francesco. He hears that he was ransomed, shoves Carlo away ignoring Giovanna and storms off.

#### [[01-18-1466]]
Andrea refuses to talk to Carlo and just glares at him in the morning. He observes as Carlo talked to Piero about his mercenary gang, a snippet about about the chair they'd taken being recovered in tirrean purple, and Giovanna paying the Seneschal (the older man) and feeding from him.

Andrea finds another staff member, Lucia in her early 20s, to feed from. She was nervous about the bite being painful, but was happy and offered again for later; she obviously was new and had not been fed from before.

Andrea and Carlo were introduced in court and accepted as the newest neonates. The Prince announced there was a lupine threat, sent off hunters, and put everyone on curfew. The coterie had to stay behind and talk to the Prince about his chair, and Andrea was charged with finding Nico. After court Pietro and the Scourge step from shadows for a quick and odd hello.

Andrea goes to the library to look for Nico and meets Maria, a Brujah there.
Andrea tries to get into the restricted section, and finds Nico. Nico writes a note to deliver to the Prince and begins giving Andrea lessons on Auspex. In return Nico wands a Lupine skull and promises it "will make sense in a few weeks".

Andrea passes someone at the top of fashion who knew him on the way to delivering the letter. He drops the letter off with the Herald who comments "you are one ugly Nosferatu".
By the time he arrives back at the manor Carlo is there sulking with wine; Andrea asks if he's okay, and Carlo's upset that he can't get drunk.

The Scourge appears and asks the coterie to work with him promising the favour of the "true" Prince of Florence. Giovanna later explains about Markus in Torpor.

#### [[01-19-1466]]
Andrea goes for the second part of his lesson with Nico in the library. 
He hears Carlo telling Giovanna stories as they walk past the library and he trails them before getting a sense of steel, oil, and fire. He then catches up to them and alerts them of possible impending fire. They then explore the catacombs and he hears a hushed conversation "we haven't found anything - Brother Thomas - she almost ate his face - brother Thomas is a drunk". Andrea sends a rat with a message to Pietro, then they are attacked by 3 human hunters. Andrea disappears and was headed out to deal with the archer when Carlo slices through the archer and into Andrea. Andrea is hurt, startled and angry, yelling at Carlo that he told him not to kill them. Giovanna comes over, pulls an arrow out of her forehead and explains cainite healing. The Scourge appears; he arrived just before the fighting starts having been send by Pietro who had hear of loud humans. He leaves again with both Obfuscate and Celerity.

When they arrive back at the manor Maria greats them, is startled that Carlo is covered in blood again and asks if that will be regular. Carlo says probably and Andrea smirks. Maria says she will find and send people for them to drink from. Andrea goes to his dark room to change his sliced clothes. Upon exiting he finds Lucia waiting for him. He expresses surprise at the speed of her recovery, to which she batts her eyes and says she volunteered when Maria was asking for people. Andrea carefully takes a minimum amount from her then guides her back and drops off her and his clothes for mending with the other servants.

Andrea then goes looking for more food, and accidentally pounces Marco, a mid twenties 
stockier stable hand who had been shaving. Andrea apologizes for pouncing before thinking and tends to Marco after feeding. He then heads to the crypt to explore some more. He finds a tunnel into the catacombs behind a shelf.

At the top of the stairs back to the manor he overhears Carlo ghouling Borzo. After Borzo leaves he warns Carlo that if he wants his mercenaries to "live" there, he better keep them out of Andrea's area, and that includes the crypt.

Andrea then listens as Leonello is ghouled.

Giovanna calls out that assuming you're like most Nosferatu you're probably listening - we should go to Elysium. Andrea then joins Carlo and Giovanna going to Elysium.
Andrea properly meets the fashionable Harpy Veronica who fixates on Carlo. To Andrea she says "Andrea, looking as dreadful as always, but at least you dress well".

They talk to Carlo the Herald who says "hear you've been exploring the Crypt, and talked to my friend" and you, Brujah "I'd advise you to stay out of my way". Afterwards Giovanna asks Carlo "what did you do to piss him off?" and he says "dunno". They talk to the Sheriff again who invites Carlo his "cousin" to meet "the boss". The Sheriff also makes negative comments about being embraced by Nosferatu being worse, and a quiet comment about Carlo not being much without his looks. Ercole gives Andrea a note with the name of a book to collect from the Tremere Chantry for his favour.

#### [[01-20-1466 - 02-01-1466]]
Andrea spends some time investigating the boon request, explored the crypt, catacombs, and library, and familiarizing himself with the manor staff.

He befriends and ghouls some of the manor's animals; the two barn cats, Pixie the female calico and Pluto the male tabby, two rats named Quinn and Thomas, and a pack of dogs made up of Cerberus, a very large male Mastiff with a black coat, Corus, a large male bloodhound with a red coat, Dust, a medium female greyhound with a grey coat, Stella, a medium female greyhound with a white coat, Bane, a medium male greyhound with a light brown coat, and Mut, a smallish male spaniel or partridge dog with a white & speckled brown coat.

He investigates who might have been the previous owner of the manor, how the manor runs and what the Seneschal manages.

#### [[02-03-1466]]
Court announces the end of curfew where 4 of the 7 hunters who left drop the skin of a lupine at the Prince's feet. After court Carlo shows enthusiasm about eventually fighting a lupine.

Andrea goes to the Chantry with his pack of dogs. The 'statues' there are alive and allow him in with Ercole's note. A short blonde blue eyed boy in the lobby sends him to Hildegarde on the fourth floor but demands he leave the dogs in the lobby. A child of age 6 greats him at the fourth floor with "you're Nosferatu aren't you, so sorry we can't fix that". Hildegarde arrives a little later, and knocks his hood off with magic. Andrea pulls it back and she knocks it off again. She makes a comment that his "curse is still shifting, that should not be". She finds the requested book and states that one drop of blood is usual for sign out. Andrea responds with "oh it's for Ercole, not me, and he didn't send me with any of that" haven received copious warnings from Giovanna not to give the Tremere his blood. Hildegarde provides an alternate method of loan for one month in the form of a slip of paper and a threat. Andrea thanks her and goes to leave. As he leaves he hears a giggle he recognizes as the imp. As he goes down the stairs he checks he has everything on him and finds a dagger in the back of his waistband. He quickly leaves the chantry with his dogs and then pauses outside to investigate the dagger. It's a beautiful dagger about 9" long with a wire worked handle, and smells of blood, both human and cainite and another kind.

Back at the manor Andrea asks Giovanna about the dagger though she doesn't know much. He delivers the book to Ercole and a stack of letters to the Herald for Giovanna. Carlo the Herald thanks Andrea for going out of his way to be nice to the rats. Andrea asks Pietro privately about the dagger. Pietro is concerned at the mention of an imp, checking Andrea is not an infernalist or in a pact with the devil or the Baali, and is surprised at when Andrea Auspex. He also doesn't know where to find a lupine skull. He does promise to look into the dagger. The Scourge gives Andrea a note for Giovanna on his way back to the manor and asks the coterie to look into Brother Thomas. Carlo and crew rowdily arrive back at the manor. After the rest of his crew leave again, a Nosferatu suddenly appears and demands "Who are you and what are you doing in my house?" His name is Ernst; Andrea tries to be friendly, Giovanna and Ernst argue before Giovanna storms off. Andrea puts together that Ernst was his sire.

#### [[02-04-1466]]
Andrea debates what to do with the dagger for a long time in the morning before deciding to hide it on himself. He comes up from the crypt to find a very happy Giovanna sitting at the fountain. She mentions training with Carlo and some Ventrue drama. She's asked Piero to look into Brother Thomas. They head to Elysium to see Carlo walking off with Veronica. Giovanna talks to Piero in private and Andrea heads to the library. Giovanna comes to the library and freaks out Nico. Andrea prompts Giovanna into ideas of where to start for looking for Brother Thomas, and then they meet up with Carlo.

All three head to a shabby inn, Andrea waits outside investigating the surroundings until Carlo motions him in from an upper window. Andrea sneaks in past where Giovanna is the centre of the inn's attention to find Carlo. Carlo fills him in on Brother Thomas and Andrea skims through the books there and suggests Giovanna change Brother Thomas' mind on going to talk to the church. Andrea thoroughly reads Thomas' notebook while Carlo fetches Giovanna.

Giovanna rewrites in his memory that nothing particularly happened with the noble woman, he was mugged by the three men (that were the hunters) and lost his notebook. Giovanna reads the notebook and recognizes Maria (from the library) as the one who terrorized Thomas. After waiting a while they leave and go find the Scourge, dropping off the book with him. Giovanna will sets Piero to watch Thomas by dropping a note off for him.

Andrea heads to the crypt for some socializing with his critters.

#### [[02-05-1466]]
Andrea awakes to find the staff oddly missing, but he does find Ernst by the fountain. He talks to Ernst for a while and asked why Ernst picked him. Ernst saw Andrea hours from battle clearly on the brink of death, but clearly not dying, which that showed Ernst that god had a plan for Andrea. He adds that god has a plan for everyone, but specifically you Andrea. Andrea also mentions the staff being missing being odd. Ernst says that he gave them the night off as one of them was missing, Leonardo (the Seneschal). Ernst says that he has a suspicion that "an old man had what old men often have happen to him" but "no one really knows" upon Andrea inquiring further. Andrea also asks about Leonardo's son Luca, to which Ernst says he will take his father's place as Seneschal.

Giovanna also comes to the fountain and says Piero got the message; Thomas seems to have stopped drinking, and improved his life. Ernst makes a comment about 'glad you can be civil'.

Giovanna apologizes saying that they caught each other at bad times for them both and Ernst says "you have my forgiveness". Carlo then joins everyone at the fountain; his reading lessons are going well. Andrea also notices that there seemed to be a ward off effect for Giovanna and Carlo from Ernst, while he was able to sit next to Ernst.
Ernst leaves for his chapel while Giovanna and Carlo leave for the eldest Brujah's. Andrea goes down to the crypt to find the shelf-door ajar and spends some more time investigating the dagger.

#### [[02-06-1466 - 04-16-1466]]

Andrea occasionally watches Elysium and eventually comes across some of the lupine hunters. He talks to a Nosferatu and Brujah and asks questions, finding out that the skull would have been burnt to ash among other lupine details including the importance of silver weapons. Nico simply says "I feel like I need one" when asked why he wants a lupine skull and shrugs off the timing questions Andrea tries to ask about his previous comments.

Andrea gets some information from Piero on the dagger but not much. Through Auspex and tasting the blood on the dagger he finds that it belonged to one of the now-dead Tremere lupine hunters.

Ercole eventually gives the book back to Andrea to take back to the Chantry where he personally drops it off with Hildegard to ensure the loan has been cleared. The book contained some bits about things that live near the abyss. Andrea also asks if he may read some of the Tremeres' books while he is there and they agree. He learns a variety of interesting things from their collection including that Lupine blood will act like steroids for physical disciplines and makes a vampire a little more prone to frenzy, books advise against pursuit of Dark Thaumaturgy (Infernalism) and there isn't a lot of information about demons other than that they are corrupting influences, and a lot of material on blood magic and a vague reference to a Nosferatu ability to encode messages in blood.

Fratellino appears occasionally and is frustratingly evasive.

Andrea visits Maria the Brujah in the library and gives her a heads up about Brother Thomas.

Andrea investigates Leonardo's disappearance by talking with his animal ghouls. Pluto describes seeing a small human dragging a large vaguely human shaped object. The small human got assistance from a very large human after a little while. Andrea guesses that the smallest human in the manor is Maria and plans to talk to her. He catches up with her after a few days and finds her spacier than normal. After a while trying to ask her questions it becomes obvious that she can't talk about it. Andrea goes to ask Giovanna about magical gags aiming questions more around Brother Thomas. He then tries to talk to Ernst as he's becoming more suspicious of Giovanna. Ernst gives straight answers for what he knows but was not particularly interested in investigations preferring to leave it "to god's will". Andrea begins to retreat more to his animals as his distrust of Carlo continues, his distrust of Giovanna builds, and he observes what seems like Ernst's detachment.

Andrea continues exploring the catacombs by himself.

Andrea tries to get to know the staff a bit more. They don't seem to have families outside of the manor, for the most part, and the ones that do prefer not to talk about them much. Marco, Ernst's preferred food source continues to be a bit twitchy but is otherwise alright. Lucia tries to offer blood to Andrea as often as she can, and he keeps a fairly close eye on how she's doing. Carlo doesn't feed off the staff much as he usually drinks while out partying or from his mercenaries. Ernst avoids any of the non-original staff.

#### [[04-17-1466]]
The Scourge appears and sends the coterie to make the annual check on Ashe, an elder Gangrel with a territory two night's ride north east from the city. Andrea asks where they should stay and the Scourge chucks a map at Andrea with the Prince's wayhouses marked towards the border with Medina. Cerberus insists on coming with Andrea, Carlo rides and Giovanna sits in the cart with Andrea driving to the first wayhouse.

#### [[04-18-1466]]
They continue on to the second wayhouse.

#### [[04-19-1466]]
They hit a point in their travels too narrow for the cart and horses, return them to the wayhouse and continue in. Andrea notices posts scattered in a rough line topped with giant-wolf skulls and nudges the others and says 'I think we hit the edge of her land'. The territory within markers is very very quiet; no longer full of life; silent. Cerberus and Andrea notice a 11' tall wolf human just behind the group, Andrea jerks his head over and Carlo notices. A blur takes the lupine down and rips the head off. When stopped Ashe tells Andrea to leave the dog by the gate as he'd bother her silver lynx. Andrea tells Cerberus it's probably safer for him anyways and he goes to wait. Ashe drags the lupine corpse back to the cabin with the coterie following. Andrea asks about getting a lupine skull after she gives the bag of teeth they were supposed to collect to Giovanna. He mentions Nico and Ashe comments that he's 'one of the only sensible ones over there', and asks for blood for her (ghouled) lynx in return. Andrea glances over at Giovanna to check that the warnings for the Tremere aren't similar, then agrees. Ashe grabs Andrea's outstretched wrist and drags him over pie plate, then slits his arm with a knife grown from her arm. She promptly verbally sits Carlo down from the edge of frenzy upon the scent of cainite blood. The injury burns and Andrea is hungrier. Ashe gives the pie plate to the cat, and licks small amount of blood off her finger commenting 'not bad quality'. She polishes a skull off to give to Andrea and and says to give her regards to Nico, and the coterie had back to the wayhouse. Carlo asking about how old she was, Giovanna answers probably about 1000 years and says he might want to work on his fortitude if he wants to live that long. She also says she can teach him.

#### [[04-20-1466]]
Carlo kills a deer and scares off all the animals by wayhouse. Andrea finds a boar for nonlethal feeding by the next wayhouse.

#### [[04-21-1466]]
They all make it back to the manor and Andrea feeds off Marco, a valet in his late teens.

#### [[04-22-1466]]
Andrea takes the most direct route to the library, with obfuscate, first thing in the new night. Nico says "you're a day late" as Andrea enters. "I thought auspex didn't give you that specific timelines". Andrea drops off the lupine skull with Nico - this Nico had no idea what to do with the skull. Andrea returns to the manor to feed and immediately finds Lucia, looking hopeful. He takes one hunger and she clings to Andrea for a moment and looks in Andrea's eyes saying "thank you". 

He heals the cut that looks burnt around the edges and needs to drink more. He steals himself not to immediately cut Lucia off going the other way and instead finds Franco in the stables.

Franco is twitchy, 'knowing there's a predator waiting for me, the other one usually just grabs me and I don't have to think about it'. Andrea asks "would you prefer that?" to which Franco just has a guppy-face look of shock. After feeding, Andrea checks he's okay, then goes to find yet another staff member. Luciano was tidying in the seneschal's office, hadn't been fed from before and commented "oh that's a lot more intense than I was led to believe". Andrea checks he's also okay then goes to look for Giovanna and Carlo.
He finds them making small talk and taps Carlo on the shoulder as they say "I wonder where Andrea is". They both jump as Andrea responds "you were looking for me?". Giovanna: "I'll never get used to that, Nosferatu just popping out of nowhere".
All three go to deliver the bag of teeth from Ashe. The Scourge comments that every 20ish years or so, the "hot headed teenage" lupines decide to not take the warnings of their elders seriously, it happens like clockwork.

Giovanna stays behind to talk to the Scourge privately for a moment. Carlo and Andrea wait in the hall and Andrea turns on heightened senses to listen. He catches that changing roads isn't easy, scolding Giovanna for making allusions to being anything other than the scourge's lackey, and something about a blood oath to the Prince and that that's now a bad thing.

Carlo heads off to spar, Andrea and Giovanna head back slowly along the long route back to the manor with small talk. GIovanna goes off to make a dress from her new fabric. Andrea goes to find food and finds Maria. 

She looks an emotional mess before seeing Andrea and putting up her mask, asking Andrea how he is. He responds "my night keeps making me hungry, but I seem to be doing better than you", and she immediately starts crying, collapsing into chair.
"She really made it so that you couldn't talk about it, didn't she." Andrea just sits with her as she cries. "I don't know what she all did to you, but it's not your fault." Maria just keeps crying. She, while still crying, slides off the chair into a sobbing puddle by Andrea's lap.
Andrea picks her back up and puts her in the chair. "So obviously you can't talk about it... but you can cry about it. Can you write about it?" He takes her hand and says "let's go find Luca".

They find Luca in the seneschal office. Andrea: "Can you find Maria a notebook?"
Luca gives Andrea a look "It could be done, but why?"
Andrea sighs, "It's a bit hard to explain but I think Giovanna made a bit of a mess." He shrugs.

Luca looks at Andrea, hugs Maria, picks her up and leaves with her.
Andrea's still hungry but there aren't really any more staff he hasn't already interacted with around by now, so he heads down to the crypt to hang out with some non-crying critters. He asks Pixie and Pluto to keep an eye on Maria.

Carlo knocks on the crypt door and asks Andrea about Nico's personalities. Andrea talks to Carlo then reads the note Giovanna had pinned to the door which said "Veronica wanted me to tell you about old friends from Milan coming to visit?". 
Andrea finds Giovanna, holds up the note: "what's this?" who told Veronica these supposed things? Giovanna responds that she said 'friends'; Veronica may just be trying to stir up trouble; toreador and all that. Giovanna also mentions having visited the Prince; it went well, "he seems to be realizing I am not my sire, etc". Andrea nods slowly waiting to see if she elaborates then leaves with laughing comment about confusing notes.

#### [[04-23-1466]]
Pixie reports that "watching humans is boooooring, after they got back all she did was make scratchy noises on a open thing" (book). Andrea is happy that the day seemed uneventful. He goes to find Luca at Seneschal's desk.

L: thank you for bringing Maria to our attention
A: how is she?
L: traumatized, still can't talk about it, but at least has an outlet now, don't know if she's slept
A: sounds about right re-traumatized, thank you for getting her a notebook, much easier for you to do that than me
L: something something walking masquerade violation?
A: yeah
L: anything else I can do for you?
A: meant to get a drink from Maria yesterday, but she wasn't in any state for that, would you mind?

There's a small catch in his breath before unbuttoning his shirt which Andrea notices as quite a different response from the response Luca gave when he first met Luca. Andrea very carefully takes one hunger from Luca who has a bliss-normal response, also a slight sigh of relief after. He says 'thank you Andrea' and Andrea thanks Luca in return, then heads off to find Ernst. He doesn't find Ernst but does see the shelf-door very slightly ajar.
Andrea comes up from the crypt to find Carlo leaving and Giovanna sitting pensively, he sits with Giovanna who mentions giving Carlo advice re-travel, and also talks about brother Thomas and waiting for a response from the scourge.

The Scourge drops down from the roof while obfuscated, runs around to be behind Giovanna when he appears; Andrea notices a little earlier and is smirking. "So Giovanna." Giovanna turns. They talk about Brother Thomas and the inquisition before he obfuscates again and jumps out the way he came in.

Giovanna: "We should look into it today, you'll be the most useful with obfuscate and animalism, but we should get Carlo too cause you'd just disappear and leave me, with good reason." Andrea laughs as she says this simply, with a straight face.

Andrea quickly goes to fetch Quinn and Thomas, puts them in his pocket, goes back to Giovanna, then Giovanna and Andrea head to the eldest Brujah's place to pick up Carlo. 

They walk in cautiously to find Alessandra and Carlo in awkward silence. Carlo intros his sire, Giovanna says has heard lots about her. "I'm sure it's all been glowing." "Much of it has been, we've both been around much longer than this incident Giovanna nods at Carlo"

The three head towards Santa Maria del la Crocha and Giovanna fills in Carlo on the way. While walking through streets towards the church, Andrea sees a couple people that stand out a bit, a little awkward and out of place, or maybe looking around a little more than normal, not sure what stands out about them but each is wearing a crucifix. The number that Andrea notices go up as they get closer, and he gets a feeling they are looking for something and lingering. Out in front of the church they see armored sections of 10-15 people, standing in formation, clearly guarding. Andrea steps aside and sends Quinn and Thomas into the church. They head down to the catacombs at an unwatched point, and talk about what to do next, Giovanna thinks they should update the Scourge. Andrea nods and immediately turns to walk in the direction of where the Scourge would be; no one else has any idea where they are until they get there. They update the Scourge then head back to the manor. After some time waiting in the crypt for the rats, they come back spooked and describe Brother Thomas being there along with a large number of inquisition. They'd only been at the church a day. They report again to the Scourge.

#### [[04-24-1466]]
Andrea awakes to Fratellino on his foot reading a leather covered, relatively unadorned book "Giovanna's been very naughty".
Did you take that from Maria? 
"Who's Maria" 
Where did you get it? 
"Off a table" 

Andrea sticks his hand out for book which Fratellino gives him.

Andrea reads a very emotional accounting in the first few pages; her being instructed to 
drag the lifeless corpse of Leonardo out of the house, mention of a hooded and cloaked man who assisted her near the end (particularly tall, particularly broad, very good at keeping his face in shadow - Andrea pieces together that she's describing Pietro). Then there is page upon page of aftermath writing. How she's  been feeling and being unable to talk about it, there is some relief at being able to write and gratitude towards Andrea and Luca.

Fratellino is hopping about bored while Andrea reads, he mentions about bringing Andrea all this info and it's not even the really interesting stuff "cause he could teach about all these infernal secrets". He mentions mages that never get his name right, Andrea asks what does to them, and he responds 'exactly what they ask for to the letter'. Fratellino eventually disappears after some more conversation, and Andrea returns the book to Maria's table while she is still sleeping.

The coterie go to investigate a pyre the inquisition is building. Andrea tells Giovanna to make a hand signal or whisper if she needs him and turns unseen. The three leave with additionally Borzo and another mercenary. The crowd is between 500 and 1000 people, The cardinal makes a speech then sets the pyre with Thomas on flame. The coterie try to leave, and as they do Andrea notices something weird about a couple of the shadows. One of the gaurds tries to cut off the group and question them, then the rest of them leave again. Andrea delivers a note to the Herald for the Scourge since he was personally never seen.

While in Elysium he asks Pietro about encoding messages in blood. Pietro asks where Andrea heard about that, Andrea shrugs and replies a book. They talk a bit more in his office before Andrea takes the tunnel exit from his office out of Elysium back to the manor again. Andrea and Giovanna talk some more and Andrea mentions the shadows. Giovanna explains a bit about the Lasombra. Giovanna writes a note while Andrea goes to feed. He finds Lucia, and takes one hunger. She holds on to Andrea and nuzzles in - 'I have a note to drop off'- oh, sorry. Andrea goes back to Elysium to update them again, only talking to Pietro this time, and they talk about the Prince being missing. Andrea fills out the remainder of the night busily fortifying the manor with the staff and also updates Ernst in his chapel.

#### [[04-25-1466]]
Andrea had stayed upstairs closer to the staff and as he stepped out of the closet he'd crashed in, he stepped into a room filled with smoke. Out into the courtyard he could see the roof was on fire. From the direction of the barracks he could hear the sounds of battle. He could see Luca motioning staff down to crypt and ran over to hear from Luca that the inquisition were here and he couldn't find Lucia or Maria. Yes his father showed him how to get out via the crypt. Andrea turned to go look for Lucia and Maria, turning on heightened senses with his beast yelling at him.

Andrea smells where Maria is over the smoke. She's in a room by Luca's office staring at the burning ceiling. He shouts her name as soon as he sees her and asks if she knows where Lucia is (she doesn't), he orders her to the crypt now, she curtsies and runs toward the crypt.

Fratellino laughs and argues with Andrea as Andrea tries to search for Lucia. Fratellino refuses to tell Andrea where Lucia is but promises to deliver Lucia.

Andrea runs back to Luca who asks "Did you find Lucia?"

"Fratellino is bringing her she should be here any moment" and there's a pop of sulphur behind Andrea. He immediately spins around and grabs Lucia by the wrist to take her down into the crypt, calling over his shoulder to Luca "is that everyone?"

Lucia is a bit stunned "I'd rather stay with you, I don't know how I got to you" Andrea mutters "I'm sure I'll pay for that later", then "I'm going to go after Carlo and Giovanna it won't be safe for you". "you'll find me later?" "mhmm" Lucia gives him a big hug before he runs back up the stairs.

Carlo and Giovanna are running in opposite directions out of the stables. Carlo is running towards the battle with celerity so he knows he won't catch him and chases Giovanna instead. He tries to calm her and give her instructions to get out safely but doesn't catch her and eventually turns back.

On his way back he passes Borzo and Leonello looking for Carlo. He tells them Carlo ran towards the battle and gives them instructions for the crypt before disappearing into the crypt himself, purposely leaving the shelf ajar behind himself.

Andrea catches up to the group of staff, Luca standing at the front swearing because he doesn't know where to go "my father didn't tell me there were this many paths". Andrea finds 10 of them there and that the stablehands Marco and Franco did not survive. The remaining group is physically fine but mentally a wreck, and Lucia is immediately clinging to Andrea. Luca and Andrea quickly discuss various logistics, and Andrea begins guiding the group towards Luca's house. It turns out Lucia had been trapped, a burning beam crossing her path with no way out and no window.

Upon getting to a catacomb exit that Luca would be able to find his way from, Luca and Andrea make a plan to meet in the mortal library tomorrow. Lucia doesn't want to leave but agrees to on the condition that she will also meet at the library tomorrow. Andrea feeds one hunger off of Maria before leaving.

On his way back to the manor Andrea find Carlo, Borzo, and a very gravely injured Leonello. He guides them directly to Elysium to ask Pietro for help. Pietro explains that the only vampires that can heal are the Salubri and they are not around. Carlo and Pietro talk about how much it is worth to Carlo to keep Leonello going, and that Leonello won't hate 
Carlo if Pietro turns him.

Andrea has a private word with Pietro; who says Markus would understand and no what happened to Ernst for Andrea won't happen to Pietro. Pietro instructs Andrea to tell Carlo it won't be cheap. Andrea leaves Carlo and Borzo sitting in an empty Elysium to go find Ernst in his chapel and inform him of the updates. Andrea discovers that Ernst specifically went to the Prince to confess turning Andrea and that otherwise the Prince doesn't tend to be able to keep track of the Nosferatu.

He then heads to a catacombs entrance and calls for his critters. Quinn, Pixie and Corus appear. He checks everyone's okay and gives directions to Luca's place in case they need somewhere to go. Quinn climbs up to his shoulder to stay with him.

Andrea stops at the library and alerts Nico about the inquisition and meeting Luca there the next day. Nico comments on Luca not being a ghoul which Andrea then realizes is not normal and should be kept hidden. Ercole isn't around which is odd.

He runs into Giovanna, wearing a fancy new dress, on the way back to Elysium.
Giovanna, Borzo, Carlo, and Andrea go talk to Habt. He has organized 2 Gangrel, and a selection of Brujah (but they don't want to commit all their troops). The Tremere have locked themselves in their tower. Pietro insists his job is to protect Elysium so is otherwise occupied. Giovanna is surprisingly war like, and there are some odd interactions between Habt and Giovanna. They plan to meet in an hour, Giovanna will go get weapons while Andrea and Carlo feed; they head out to a cattle farm.

Andrea gets back to the meeting section early and watches Giovanna oddly pacing back and forth past the intersection with a servant and a cart.

Andrea picks up an additional dagger, a sword, bow, and a sheaf of arrows. When Habt gets there he examines the blueprints Habt got from Nico of the church.

The coterie are to take on whoever's in the building while the others clear outside. Andrea turns invisible while Giovanna rips off the door and makes a huge amount of noise. 3 ornately dressed people come around the corner and seem to be immune to cainite magic. Andrea starts to shoot but turns to find another just about to stab him. They grapple and the cardinal presses a cross to Andrea's face which burns. Carlo throws a hunger frenzying Giovanna onto the cardinal as Andrea disengages. Andrea checks the rooms around them while Giovanna acts with disdain towards Nosferatu, calling herself "Christophero". Andrea then leads the group back to the previous meeting place following bloody footprints.

Carlo starts to say that Giovanna went insane to Habt who shoves a hand over his mouth. Giovanna commands him to stop talking and whispers that she'll explain later. The Gangrel and Brujah leave and Giovanna says she has Piero and another ghoul she'd acquired that night who could help clean up the mess.

Habt asks Andrea if he has any rats or anyone that could bring a stack of notes to the Nosferatu portion of the catacombs. "I'm on passable terms with the Nosferatu and we'll need more hands up there". Andrea smiles and takes Quinn out of his pocket. "You Nosferatu will never cease to amaze me, bringing a rat into this..."

Habt gives Giovanna a "we will talk later when he's not around".

Giovanna brings Andrea and Carlo to her new house where Andrea can smell the faintest whiff of blood throughout the entire house.

Andrea investigates the surroundings while waiting for Giovanna to talk to her ghouls. The rooms are pristine and extremely well appointed.

Giovanna comes back and explains that the house used to be her sire's but she diablerized him earlier that night. They are welcome to stay there. Andrea asks about how control switches; it seems to be in distracted moments.

Giovanna and Carlo discuss Diablerie and argue about mental and physical fighting. 

Andrea watches them with growing distrust.

#### [[04-26-1466]]
The church burns during the day.

Quinn is back in Andrea's pocket when he wakes up, with a simple note in the Scourge's writing "thank you". Andrea sends Quinn with a very quick note to Ernst including the address of the new location, then heads to the library quickly.

Nico lost a few days and Ercole isn't around. Andrea fills him in that the inquisition were there but have hopefully been removed. Andrea heads to door Luca and Lucia would most likely be enter through hoping to keep them away from Nico. He almost runs into Luca at the door who freaks out and runs away screaming. Andrea realizes too late to chase Luca that he won't just settle. Lucia stands watching, wearing a daring dress partially covered by a shawl. Andrea walks her to the new manor, giving her some updates along the way. Upon entering the manor she lets the shawl drop and suggests feeding Andrea. He tries to take one hunger but she refuses to let go. He eventually manages to pry her off partially by force of will, having taken what would have been three hunger worth of blood. She's still conscious but breathing very shallowly and he's not sure she'll stay conscious. He leans over to attempt to give her back blood to heal her, biting his lip and kissing her. She almost immediately holds on to Andrea just as tightly as before. "You didn't tell me receiving was as good as giving, I would have done that a long time ago!" "That was a very stupid thing to do, that very nearly got you killed." "I would have done it anyways, still would have gotten me what I wanted." *glares*

Andrea heals himself a bit and continues monitoring Lucia. She seems almost high. He directs her to sit in the library which she seems to do without thinking. He irritably tries to mostly ignore her and investigate the library which has lots on running businesses, lots of ledgers, some books on war tactics, and a section of Roman authors in Latin. After a while when Lucia seems to still be stable Andrea asks if she can find Luca and ask him to bring the staff to the manor while he heads to Elysium.

He runs into Giovanna and they talk to Habt where Giovanna says Veronica unknowingly told her info about Lasombra from Milan planning to bring down the Prince.

Giovanna and Andrea head into Elysium, catch Carlo's eye from the dance floor, and the three talk to Pietro in his office.

They all head back to the manor to find that Lucia has very successfully assembled the staff. Luca walks over to Andrea, embarrassed, to tell him that Lucia slapped him several times to snap him out of it. "She seems quite... motivated..." "We can talk about that later if you'd like."  Luca would appreciate that. In the meantime, they discuss moving the staff into the new space and Luca decides he does not actually want to ask what Giovanna did with the previous staff of the new place. Everyone disperses, and Andrea goes to the manor's library to talk more privately with Luca. He asks Luca what his father told him about ghouling; Luca knows about not aging and being very attached to the domitor; Ernst always talked about it in negative terms. Andrea explains that was what accidentally happened to Lucia as a result of her rash actions. She says "I'd thought I'd lost everything" and Andrea softens, sits and pats chairs. Luca sits down in a chair, Lucia sits on the floor beside Andrea. Andrea says to her  "just don't do that again", and she responds extremely sincerely "I won't". Andrea goes on to explain that Lucia has only partially turned to a ghoul, Luca is surprised that it could be partial, and Andrea explains that it can wear off if you let it. Lucia looks stricken. Luca asks why Andrea is telling him about ghouling and Andrea replies that he'd asked why Lucia was so motivated and he was explaining what happened. Luca makes some odd comments about Andrea being raised by a Ventrue and about Ernst or Carlo who would eventually become more Brujah. Andrea makes clear that he's not Giovanna or any of the others and tries to reassure Luca that he doesn't have plans to ghoul Luca, but Luca doesn't seem content.

The conversation extends to that Maria did manage to talk to Luca about her journal. Luca says he's glad she had an outlet, it probably saved her life. Andrea says he's sorry about what Giovanna did. Luca replies that it was not Andrea's sin to atone for and shrugs. Andrea suggests they should maybe get Maria another notebook as the last one probably burned, and Luca says he will check.

Luca makes a comment that them (vampires) just view us (humans) as food sources but that Andrea actually seems to care about the staff, and comments about Ernst spending increasing amounts of time in his chapel since his punishment. Andrea says that Ernst will be welcome in the new manor as he doesn't know if Ernst has anywhere else to go with the old manor burnt down, though he may choose to live at his chapel. He continues that Ernst probably had reasons for not ghouling Luca's family. And Luca agrees that they were likely religious reasons of not wanting to damn them with Ernst's curse. Andrea adds that Luca organized well in an emergency, and got everyone out that he could. He thanks him and says "Ghoul or not, that makes you a great Seneschal." 

Andrea supposes he should tell Luca where the new manor comes from, and makes a comment about Giovanna not looking at just humans as food sources. Luca's eyes go wide and he mouths "Amaranth?", Andrea nods once. "She is unlikely to be able to feed off of any of you but do be careful." He explains about Giovanna's feeding restriction, and Luca mutters a line about beware of gifts from Greeks, remembering his father's stipend which enabled Giovanna to feed off of his father. Andrea turns to Lucia for a warning but she has vanished. "Did you see her leave?" "No." "I'm right here." Andrea turns on heightened senses and sees lingering wisps of some sort of mists like dispersing smoke leaving from around Lucia, and assumes Lasombra involvement.

Giovanna walks in, with a tiny scroll tied in a black ribbon that absorbs light and has no shine, she doesn't seem to have noticed it tucked into her belt, Andrea asks what that is as he takes it out of her belt; the note says "we have them".

After reading the note, Andrea immediately spins around and grabs Lucia's hand to keep ahold of her. Giovanna's ghouls have been missing since the church burnt down and the Lasombra are obviously targeting them. Giovanna smirks; she didn't see Lucia before Andrea grabbed her from behind him but immediately puts together that she's now a ghoul, then she blanches and then grabs the paper and reads it again gripping it so hard she almost rips it.

Andrea asks why the Lasombra are targeting the ghouls but Giovanna doesn't know. Andrea startles as he wonders if Borzo is still there. Giovanna stomps up the stairs to find Borzo with Andrea tailing her with Lucia in tow.

Andrea stops suddenly at the top of the stairs as Giovanna throws open a door, announces "good you're still here", turns, and is skewered through by a very startled Borzo.

Andrea sends the dogs off to search for Giovanna's ghouls over the day.

#### [[04-27-1466]]
Luca and Lucia are standing outside his cupboard door in the morning waiting for him, and they go to the library to talk before anyone else gets up. The staff are unanimous that they are staying, but they have some conditions as they recognize the danger of working for cainites (like the inquisition coming to burn down your home). The first condition is a raise, Andrea agrees that he will inform Giovanna. The second condition Luca thinks he may have to fight Andrea for - they want to switch to working for Andrea over Ernst. His family has been working for Ernst for a long time and while Ernst did care for them, "where was he when the chapel burnt down, when the staff was getting killed, who was it that put themselves in danger to try to save them from the fire, etc". Andrea stares at Luca then says "I am not Giovanna, I am not stealing from my Sire." Luca reiterates that he thought he might have to argue on this point and Andrea sighs "I don't suppose you know where Ernst is?" "No, that's part of the problem." "We should find him... any other conditions?" Luca replies that there is one personal condition that they can talk about later. Andrea sighs more and mutters about there being too many people to find today.

He walks out to find Giovanna, and they go to the front to meet Cerberos. Cerberos sadly reports that they followed scents but kept ending directly in walls. Andrea pokes his head back in the manor to update Carlo and Lucia; Giovanna leaves and Carlo goes to catch up with her.

Andrea heads out to a cattle farm to feed and heal. On the way back he stops at Ernst's chapel to find him sharpening a sword. He says "you handled yourself well against those *sneers* inquisitors." Andrea is startled that Ernst was there for that and thanks him. Ernst seems to have had a drastic personality change and is now set on being an avenging angel, taking a crusade to the Vatican against the inquisitors. He says he will fight the Lasombra if they get in his way, but that they will see sense. As he is about to leave, Andrea asks "what of the shell of your manor, or your staff?" Ernst pauses for a second "I had not thought of that... the manor is yours, the staff to do as their families will have them do." then walks out with sword in his left hand, a bundle over his right shoulder "You may not walk the path of Christ, but strive not to lose yourself to the beast you have become and I will be proud of you" and Ernst fades from view.

Back at manor, Andrea informs Luca that he spoke to Ernst, he is leaving on crusade and the staff are free to do as they will. Luca asks to drop the formalities of their stations and awaits Andrea's assent before saying "I am not my father, I am not going to trust the staff to... I am not going to go blindly into the night in service to one of you without some guarantees that I am not going to wind up like my father. As such it is my wish to be as Lucia, to be your ghoul, if the staff of this house must serve you, and they wish to do so, I will not allow that to happen if I can't be more valuable to you than a food source. I don't want to be seen as a a quick meal, I want to be of more use to you. Being a ghoul I know that there are places I can go that I wouldn't be able to otherwise etc and I know that that value grants myself some degree of protection. I would rather have something to not feel the constant looming death hanging over me." Andrea argues with him for a bit, pointing out that being a ghoul is not a guarantee and he would lose much freedom (including having a family in the way his paternal line had) in the process, but Luca is steadfast. Eventually, Andrea takes a vial from his belt, bites his lip, spits into the vial and places it on the table with yet another warning that there wouldn't be going back from that point. Luca nods, takes the vial and drinks it with an expression mixed between ecstasy and revulsion. He then looks Andrea in the eye and asks to be excused. He leaves with a solemn cast to go organize the staff.

Giovanna enters the manor library and Andrea matter of factly tells her there will be a raise for the staff from the manor's estate. She says she has a location for the Lasombra but does not want to go in haste.

Carlo arrives, disheveled.

Giovanna and Carlo and Andrea make a plan to head to the Lasombra and try to negotiate for Giovanna's ghouls very soon. Giovanna and Carlo each go to feed while Andrea updates Lucia very quickly then heads out to meet the scourge. Habt doesn't recognize Andrea's knock and mutters "that girl is going to get me killed" when Andrea explains the situation. He gets some information on the Lasombra from Habt then heads to the meeting spot.

While waiting he writes a long list of instructions for Luca heading forward, including logistics, rebuilding the burnt manor, and Andrea's desire to be more aware of the management of things.

Andrea vanishes after the other two arrive and stays invisible during the meeting with the Lasombra. Giovanna argues with shadows, and after the meeting Andrea scribbles a note to leave under Habt's door that they survived.

Once visible back at the manor they discuss the meeting via written notes. As they head to Elysium, Andrea hands Lucia the note he wrote for Luca and she asks if there is anything else the staff can do; he warns them to beware of shadows.
Andrea spends some time on the edge of Elysium silently with Nico and Pietro. Nico seems to enjoy the quiet hovering - listening to the sounds of Elysium while not being talked at because he's standing with two Nosferatu. Eventually Giovanna concocts a flimsy excuse to visit Habt and Andrea follows. Habt however is not there, so they return to the same arrangement in Elysium. Nico makes a comment about secrets while looking at Giovanna. Andrea wonders what Nico knows, and Nico makes a comment in his book to talk to Andrea about it later "black veins". After Nico leaves, Andrea and Pietro talk in Pietro's very well lit office and Andrea fills him in on the Lasombra. As they return to Elysium, the Herald announces "Prince Cosimo has called a court here, tomorrow, midnight, all must be in attendance."

Andrea looks over to Pietro "he's back?"
Pietro "Oh that can't be good"

#### [[04-28-1466]]
When Andrea rises the next night, there is a presence he isn't used to, Luca and Lucia waiting outside his cupboard door. Lucia insisted Luca tell Andrea the manor is well lit, Luca can sit down to go over the note at Andrea's convenience. Andrea feeds off of a day staff member who had switched to the night shift. He and Carlo both hear screaming from outside and run towards the source, Carlo faster of course. As Andrea catches up, he recognizes Piero, but as a predator about to jump onto a human woman. Andrea tries to get Piero's attention and snap him out of whatever is going on as Carlo scoops up the human and runs off in a blur. Piero is trying to attack Andrea as Giovanna arrives. Carlo reappears and tries to drag Piero into an alley in a blur. Andrea's still confused, and Giovanna sadly explains to everyone that the Lasombra turned Piero into a wight and she'd have to stake and kill him. Carlo helps her stake Piero then leaves him on a roof. Andrea notices a heap of a woman in the alley and asks Carlo to send someone from the staff with medical knowledge as Carlo and Giovanna leave. Carlo says "it's the cow all over again" and Andrea stares at him incredulously, both grateful that he tackled Piero and exasperated that he can't seem to control his speed/strength combination.

Luca finds Andrea who explains "Carlo tried to save her, but at Carlo strength and speed". Luca assesses her and concludes she wouldn't recover and it would be more compassionate to kill her than anything else. Andrea reluctantly agrees and kills the woman in the gentlest way he could think of, by draining her. Doing so, he sees images of her, Jana, and her family, and the experience of the world through her eyes that night. It strikes Andrea for the first time since waking as a cainite that he isn't hungry at all.
The coterie head to Elysium for court. Prince Cosimo begins talking before a shadow walks in and drops his hood, in Francesco's voice he announces "may I present Lord Paulo". The shadow that they interacted with in the catacombs steps forward and drops his hood, asking if Cosimo is ready to step down. Markus enters the room and everyone immediately drops to their knees in a bow. "How dare you fail me ... can't even sleep a century without you ruining my city." Markus beheads Cosimo, then turns to the Lasombra to order them to leave.

He demands the diablerist Cosimo mentioned come forward, Giovanna steps forward and admits to diablerizing Christophero and Veronica. Markus assigns Habt to clean up the mess he was involved in and Habt kills Giovanna without struggle. Court is dismissed, Andrea tries to talk to the Lasombra before they leave but Carlo grabs Andrea's wrist and drags him back to the manor. They argue there before Carlo suggests that maybe Pietro knows a way to get a letter to a Lasombra-Francesco. Andrea stands suddenly and with Carlo carefully following him heads through different catacomb paths. Before Carlo realizes it, they are back to the area of the Lasombra's room, where there are two shadowy figures. Andrea talks to Paulo, refuses to aide the Lasombra the way Veronica had, and does not manage to retrieve the other of Giovanna's ghouls. As he leaves with Carlo he says loudly "Give my fond regards to Francesco."

### [[Between the Arcs]]
He buries Gianna at the manor, and has Luca be the messenger to tell Gianna's son a story that Gianna risked her life to save a visiting wealthy merchant from a murderer, but died in the process. In thanks the wealthy merchant set up a representative ([[Luca]]) to ensure that the remaining family was taken care of at least until they were of age. (Subtext of wealthy merchant is traveling far, far away, don't bother trying to track them down to meet them or anything.)

Andrea is horrified by what [[Paolo]] chose to do to and then with the shell of Piero, and does not want to help or associate with Paulo in any way whatsoever

Andrea doesn't use [[Ernst]]'s chapel, but he respectfully does upkeep on it in case Ernst ever comes back, and stocks it for emergencies. The old manor is slowly rebuilt, with an eye for security, with as nonflammable materials as possible.

[[Carlo du Vido]] and [[Andrea Vasari]] are not held responsible for [[Giovanna Rosso]]. They are granted Christophoro's manor as a place to stay.

[[Maria]] and [[Luca]] become increasingly close over the first few years. They start dropping hints which Andrea rather pointedly ignores. Luca and Maria eventually book a meeting with Andrea where he sighs "I know what you're going to ask, you haven't exactly been being subtle. Didn't I warn you about this?" They beg him to turn Maria to a ghoul, and he eventually winds up just placing a vial on the table again the same way he did with Luca after a while of arguing and warning.

Upon touring [[Maria]] around to show her cainite places as a new ghoul, [[Nico]] complains about finding library help ([[Ercole]] died investigating the abyss during the inquisition period), and Andrea arranges Maria to work in the library for Nico long term in exchange for continuing training on Auspex from Nico.

Andrea learns Fortitude; this presents as damage simply working into his shifting curse as he ignores it. He also learns Blood Apocrypha, and spends significant amounts of time working on his speed while exploring the catacombs further.

Andrea is able to find that the dagger he was given is an athame (ritual knife), and that it was a focus for one of the Tremere. But he doesn't know the specifics of the ability - other than that blood that is spilled on it stays fresh almost indefinitely in the sheathe.
