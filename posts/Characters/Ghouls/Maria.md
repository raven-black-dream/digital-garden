## Other Plot Notes

Maria is married to [[Luca]] and they are approaching the idea of having children. 

She had been working at the manor for a while, and used to be primarily on the day staff. She was tapped to be the door person on the overnight shift when the coterie all took over the manor. She's one of the most literate of the staff members.
