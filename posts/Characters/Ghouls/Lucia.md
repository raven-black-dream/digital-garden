## Other Plot Notes

Lucia is an addict. She is addicted to Andrea's blood, and to Andrea feeding on her. The thinks that she is in Love with him. Though this is likely to be more centred around her need for the bliss that he provides her. 

At some point in the new arc she should try to push things a bit. Test the lengths that the blood bond will allow her to push.

There should also be some amount of putting her in danger some how. Andrea is very attached to his ghouls and his staff. I think that it would be interesting to put a bit of pressure on them.

5'4"ish, dark hair, dark eyes, olive skin, early 20s (23?)
