# In Pontem Umbrae
## Brief information
Title translation: On the Bridge of Shadows

Written by a Lasombra Abyss Mystic, it talks a bit about the Road of the Abyss, about the creatures which live in the Abyss, and about some rituals of Abyss Mysticism. Though it handles them in muc the same way that a period cook book does. Leaving out key points that the reader clearly already knows in order to  be reading this book.
